# Lasso-That-Football
My project is named ‘Lasso that Football’, excuse the pun! I aim to predict footballer valuations, using FIFA attribute scores and with the aid of sentiment analysis (based on forum chat concerning each player). I chose to do this project as I am passionate about the sport and am an avid Arsenal fan. I thought it would be interesting to see if I could accurately predict football players valuations, as the potential audience is massive!  My project is still a work in progress, as I have spent the majority of my time collecting and cleaning the data. I really enjoyed that aspect as I ran into many roadblocks. I enjoyed the challenge, and pursued it relentlessly until I found solutions. I encountered web scraping issues with selenium, which taught me how to refine and add complexity to my code. I encountered dataset merging struggles, which led me to discover the ‘fuzzy wuzzy’ library / levensteins ratio (which was fascinating). Unfortunately, I ran into some issues with the NLP feature of my dataset. Moving forward, I would like to continue working with Stanford CoreNLP and/or Vader to compile a compound score using footballer’s twitter feeds, as I found the chat forum text I had originally scraped wasn’t adequate. On top of that, I would also like to model my data using TimeSeries to see if my accuracy improves.
