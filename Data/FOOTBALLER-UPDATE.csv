Son is way better When I saw Pogba at Juventus I of course recognized also his raw talent The elegance of his ball touch is unbelievable somehow how he picked bad passes up with his long legs and handled it so smooth recognized me of some of Ibras skills no I dont say they are similiar in another ways just how they pick up passes from the air  But at Juventus he had also a nearly perfect team for his stage Asamoah and Vidal cleaned everything and gave him the room for skills long shots and they were able to cover him when he was going forward to do something Also he got them nice passes from maestro Pirlo himself  Imo the move to United was brave but he could have worked more on his weaknesses in Turin Also when I see his defensive workrates most of the times at his club career and than how well and perfect he can work defensive wise at France even with another powerhouses like Kante and Matuidi! I sometimes got the feeling he isnt 100 on the pitch By raw talent Pogba could have become the best midfielder of the decade for sure this height and physique combined with that skill and ball movement isnt anywhere else when he started his career until now he got the complete package just by talent   Im honestly thinking about the possibilities and what a player he could have become if he would have stayed a bit more and than would have gone for example to Madrid where Ronaldo could have teached him many things of mentality where Modric and Benzema play with him beautiful passes and Casemiro would clean the dirty shit so Pogba could concentrate more on his skills and gamechanging abilities And with the greatest french midfielder ever as his coach   Pogba once said something like he would love to combine strenghts of many icons together when Im right he mentioned CR7 Vieira Zidane and so on and goddamn this dude could have made it Dont get me wrong Pogba is fucking important for United and last season was good from him but he could have done far more by now He could be more than a world cup winner he could be many times champions league winner he could be a living legend right now instead of getting criticized by some old United legends cause he is the expensive star in an unbalanced squad,3011,13,7

Giroud with the NT might be the exception that confirms the rule but fited well into the system  If you actually had seen him play you objectively wouldnt have said such things I love the fact you aggressively defend a player whos so injury prone and hasnt been in form in recent seasons   Varane is a much more consistent defender than Umtiti   I dont think I was aggressive on my later post  I just criticized the fact you consider him as overhyped Youre right when you say he is injury prone and lost his form in the past seasons but it doesnt necessarily mean the hopes placed in him were unjustified And I guess its easier for Varane to be more consistent when he is not constantly injured like his compatriot 8183 just 2 years ago he was our best defender and a top 5 in the world now look what happen to him i hope he can get back his form somehow  Could he be converted into a destroyer CDM?,1189,0,5

No Thats an icon not this piece of shit You need these kinds of players or Football will go soft Gattuso got an icon card and I would wager that Diego Costa checks under his bed every night for Genarro You dont need these types no You need good players that dont cheat or use shortcuts to win but competes to be the best instead If you like the first ones you like Trump too Thats exactly the way he have become what he has become Try to think before you make up an opinion not call people legends because they do stupid shit people shouldnt do I agree with the other guy Costa deserves an icon Look at Trump he has had the highest US employment rate ever in the history of presidents Meanwhile look at Obama I respect both but his kindness towards Iran prompted them to get the money to buy all kinds of weapons to yield with eventually attacking the US embassy not too long ago Trumps a tough dude in this situation saying that he will attack Iran Also the good players that dont cheat or use shortcuts to win isnt right Every player has fouled to put it in a sarcastic way Also Casemiro cheated in a soccer tryout in Brazil He was a striker who scored plenty of goals with his head but there were too many players trying out for that position so he decided to become a defensive midfielder Im not sure if this sounds mean but I think you should think before you make one up seeing his history and not just his personality People out there are making preicon cards for Ramos with editing and other stuff According to your logic this shouldnt happen Oh but this is Ramos were talking about isnt a good enough excuse Call it football Im not from USA and youre only like 4 of the world Trump have of course gotten more people employed when hes subsidising the coal and oil industry but he destroys the world by doing it He does it only to trick people to vote on him hes still an awful bully you should be ashamed of as the rest of the world is Enough about him  Is it cheating to change position? Ramos has always used dirty tricks just in the CL final against Liverpool he managed to get the keeper a brain injury by elbowing him and injuring Salah We cant make that kind of people icons They just dont deserve it  Trick people to vote on him is Im sorry but isnt a good reason Dude you dont have any evidence that Trump is an awful bully and he proved to be economically successful That thought just means youre in the WE ALL FOLLOW THE WHAT THE MEDIA THINKS AND WE HATE TRUMP club Also when Obama was president he mispronouned alot of words and when Trump mispronounces it the whole media goes OHH HE DOESNT DESERVE TO RUN THIS COUNTRY HE DOESNT EVEN KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE OUR LANGUAGE To me it sounds like bullying Now dont take me wrong here Im not a supporter of Trump but it just seems really unfair about the treatment he gets from the press  Also its not cheating to change a position its just that according to your logic the whole idea of shortcuts Casemiro decided to go to an easier route to go to the highest level Your fronts and backs dont match  Ramos always uses dirty tricks Wow thats totally new But thats not the point Im saying people are already making Ramos icons Based on THAT idea it just sounds unfair that Diego Costa isnt after a fairly succesful careerthough hes not doing that good these days and CAN deserve it like Quincee said  Irrelevant question are you korean?,1116,2,8

Just because hes not in form this season doesnt mean hell continue like this in the next   Im confident hell be clinical again provided he stays injury free especially with UEFA Euro 2020 coming up in a few months Great timing!    8283 Wtf stop trolling Should be 8888 overall  CF as his first position?

So youre basing it on the winlose ratio with and without Laporte Surely youre just joking around? Did it not occur to you to analyse it deeper than shallow numbers? If you did then youd take into account the form of the whole team strength and oppertunities of the opposition the loss of players most notably Kompany who despite not playing all the games  was a genuine leader the form of the collective team and individuals Then you add in the conceded goals how theyve come to pass and how a laporte would have dealed with such a situation while also taking into account the present weaknesses of an in form Laporte  As you can see Im more thorough The fact that you state that Laporte is more important for City than van dijk for Liverpool destroys your opinion unfortunately The press starts with the defensive line by keeping the space between defense and midfield small so that the midfield can press in a smaller space This means playing with lots of space behind On top of that Liverpool basically plays with two cbs while the fullbacks attack and advance Usually its only one fullback And sometimes a midfielder joins in between the cbs Much is asked of his positional play and recoveryspeed while also being asked never to lose an aerial duel in those areas Can laporte fill in such a role? Of course not Hes not a leader nor can he organize Hes poor in the air compared to van dijk and he doesnt have his speed In duels Laporte is also the lesser player The Frenchman is the second best cb in the league when hes in form but hes still miles behind van dijk for obvious reasons  Not sure why you bring up goals and assist since were talking about defenders Do you actually watch the full games or only the highlights? A leader and organizer is both vocal and assertive in putting his defense in place A good example is how the line is formed especially for offside traps Liverpool has the most effective offside trap in the league facts He also leads by example by dominating by being an icon on the field This is why he has the fearfactor The coach of the opposition adjusts his tactics to avoid van dijk Compare that to Laporte whos physically inferior in speed inferior in the air inferior and positionally inferior Just watch van dijks passive defending by strategically placing himself into passing lanes forcing the opponent to halt the attack They also dont try to run at him if it can be helped Laporte is positionally not bad but its not elite His strong points is that he can carry the ball forward that hes left footed that he has some football intelligence and is a consistent performer City won the league with Stones Otamendi and Kompany before Laporte came Youre underrating how good Kompany is on and off the field Someone that can inspire an icon will give a team wings belief of invincibility and momentum Laporte doesnt have that in his locker 1 You say youre more thorough but you didnt include a single number or stat Im not doing research for you mate 2 Youre not giving Liverpools other defender enough credit City has had 11 defenders that I can count play in the back 4 over the last two years Pool has had 6 or 7 maybe? Most of those are just other CBs to partner with VVD That kind of consistency means you can afford to lose one star defender and still have a cohesive unit  3 City also plays with fullbacks advancing and a CDM falling into defense so I dont see how that destroys my point Youre being dramatic buddy You guys press more and injuries have made us adapt our system ie ZinDelph dont have the same attacking presence as Mendy for instance But we Laporte still kept a great line all of last year despite needing to improvise which says a lot to his versatility and leadership  4 You say miles behind VVD for obvious reasons and Laporte of course cant make recover runs and win aerial duels but you arent giving actual reasons Youre just say VVD does things and Laporte doesnt do things Have you ever debated something before? 5 I bring up goals and assists for that exact reason It shows aerial ability an attacking mindset and a fear factor which you claim Laporte doesnt have 6 Laporte whos physically inferior in speed inferior in the air inferior and positionally inferior I never argued any of this and positionally inferior is the only one up for debate but that cant be proven either way so ill leave it alone But just because you arent as good as VVD doesnt mean you cant be elite 7 Of course I understand how important Kompany was to the locker room and nobody would say that Laporte adds the same effect in that regard But there is experience and leadership in the locker room with David Aguero Dinho and KDB all highly respected And Laportes definitely adds swagger on the field that many say DOES give him an Xfactor and his ability to lead on the field not saying off the field So when you lose that on field defensive leadership everything goes awry 8 Stones and Ota didnt win the league before Laporte came Both of their first titles with City came in 1718 the season Laporte arrived So thats just wrong Another reason to explain why everything went wrong after his injury so thanks for the teeing me up bruv  8991 By far the best CB in the PL after VVD Probably top 3 with VVD and Koulibaly Chiellini  Hold my pasta Chiellini in the year 2020  When is he going to get capped for France?

How long has he been out total  9 months? Sad  Fuck the plastics and the haters its not his fault that the board and Valverdes donkeys have rushed him to come back from injury and that has obviously caused him stress its not easy to be a young Barcelona player being injured and then you have to be told we need you earlier then the expected return date sure Dembele has to get some blame as well but at the end of the days this is all down due to our clueless board which is run by spastics and Valverde and his shit coaching staff!!  Also people saying here and in social media that hes wasted his career hes fucking 22 years old calm down by the time goes hell be more mature and more disciplined when he returns back believe me on that because hes and incredible player on his day and hell prove every single one of his doubters or haters wrong!!  CourageDembouz  You lot always find a way to blame the board  or the management somehow Dembele is known to have attitude problems His lifestyle evolve around fast foods and video gaming Did the board also make him turn up late for training as well? Stop blaming valverde for everything He is not even associated with your beloved club any more Players must take their own responsibilities off pitch You do know that Valverde has nothing to do with this injury right? He got injured in training when coming back from injury a month after Valverde was sacked Dmebele and asensio were supposed to be future ballen dor contenders But that looks to be fading away sadly Its very sad man  Never  hurt Dortmund Fans Look at Dembeles injuriesGundogans season long injuryMkhitaryan and Hummels Off form Mkhitaryan had one world class season He was always a bum  Side note what did Reus do? you just have to feel sorry for him great for dortmund and the injuries ruined him gotta Say it needs to be sold and that sucks I was so stoked when he signed man  This sucks I really wanted him to succeed at Barca but they need to sell him asap They are going to take a big hit on the price but its better now than later when they are going to have to loan him out until his contract runs out He never got his personal life together in order to jump to a team like Barca I dont think he worked physically enough and Im sure he hasnt made enough efforts in his diet I remember when Messi was 1819 he had 2 muscle injuries one that made him miss the Champions League final and after that he changed everything in his personal life He started working much harder to gain strength and he completely changed his diet and habits I just dont see Dembele doing that I certainly hope he proves me wrong ,1670,8,13

I would say so the only thing he really needs in order to become a world class player is a great partner  Yes and no  Could he play as a left back for Italian NT? Is he quick enough for that position? No No Okay why not? Do you think it is only speedrelated? Daley Blind has played as a left back for the Netherlands for years and I think Romagnoli has a higher sprint speed than him Chiellini being a central defender has played as a left back several times as well also for Italy I dont think that Chiellini was much faster back in those days than Romagnoli is now am I right?   Mancini does not have a lot of good options for the left back position With both Acerbi and Chiellini being higher in the picking order it is not likely that Romagnoli will play as a central defender at EURO 2020 because Bonucci will play as a RCB despite being a relatively very good defender I think Mancini should consider to at least try Romagnoli as a left back in the upcoming friendlies No We should simply play with 3 at the back given that there is not a single Italian full back worth calling up  Thats also an option indeed you and Donnarumma go away while youre still young! Milan dont deserve you Alessio could be a starter in any team in Premier or spanish League except Barca or Real That makes no sense Barcelona dont even have a particularly good defence well Pique and Lenglet are no so bad I think Lenglet is pretty average No way near as good as his FIFA rating,2849,2,10

Nope  We are definetly not interested in him He is as good as Jantscke so it wouldnt make much sense to buy him for 30million as a Backup Southampton overpayed a lot  Fair point hes been horrendous for Southampton this season and after being dropped they did a complete 180 He probably needs to leave to get his confidence back he should play Cdm we dont have a classic no 6 Anchor man Plus to play cdm you are not required to be physical  Should leave on loan to a less physical league to get consistent game time Both him and Zouma are not good enough u have to admit zouma has been class he just needs a solid partner Koulibaly i suppose Mainly bc he is leader and players like tomori and christenseneven ake are v young and not leaders Hes got the talent But hes also got the Morata mentality  agreed no confidence and shows lack of authority and strength in defence 7884,615,0,3

He will stay one kind of a BVB Legend for me!  It was Guardiola who ruined his career He was pretty decent when he got playtime at Bayern He always tried his best and had a couple of good games but Guardiola still prefered Thomas Müller as a CAM I think he was angry because he wanted Neymar However instead he got another slow CAM he cant work with because Götze failed as a Winger and also CMCDM was not the right position for him Can someone explain me how he doesnt have 84 or 85??

Yes but not earlier than next year Can he go to EURO? Nope only as soon as 2021 starts I think he needs to spend 5 years in Portugal 71 league games in a row Btw if Spain doesnt want him just tell us Im sure Portugal would take him He has a problem in that for some reason LB is Spains best covered position at the moment Alba Reguilon Gaya Bernat Firpo all are pushing for the spot After the euro tho Alba will probably be done so the order of LB would prob be Gaya Reguilon Grimaldo  The only player in there better than Grimaldo is Alba Id say that hes at par with Reguillon whos really complete but hes also better than the other three that you mentioned Should get a chance Well have to see Having Luis Enrique as they national team coach and the fact that he plays in Portugal will make it harder for Grimaldo to get a chance I hope he does soon though Having him Reguilon and Gaya at LB would be great after alba retires Grimaldo is way ahead of Reguilon  come to chelsea I think that he was doing better last season when compared to this one but Im glad hes at the club and even renewed his contract I hope he can score goals again with that amazing tomahawk shot of his like he was doing last season! ,3052,4,15

If he was there he could take penalty kicks instead of Messi Has an amazing  on penalty kicks with Roma   The current starting lineup as against Iceland is a joke The team is playing nowhere near the level of its individual players which has to go back to the coach He is the problem How can a team with Messi Aguerro Dybala and Higuain NOT be scoring 34 goals a game?!!! Tying 11 with a team like Iceland late in the game why not put Dybala in to take some of the playmaking load off Messi? They are similar but when you have to score you can go all in?  As to defense which is embarrassingly bad for a team of this level why the heck is Fazio not playing??!! Arguably one of the top 5 or so defenders in Serie A which is one of the most defensive minded top leagues in Europe He was a rock with Roma this year And has improved considerably with the ball which was a weakness   Which begs the question does the coach have something against Argentine players playing in Italy? I dont know how people cant see this theyre a bunch of good individual players sharing the same nationality  they are not a team like germany spain etc Youre right to say thats a fault of the coach  but look at the mentality of some players you got higuain augero messi and dybala  thats a shitload of skill  but theyre all  except messi  the kind of single minded players also argentina got the problem of having 80 little and light weighted players in their team  they dont have a good versatility   Look at spain they got technical skilled players like iniesta and isco  but also that strong forces like pique and ramos same for a real team like germany the only rather big player i recognise from argentina is fazio  Pretty hard for a coach imo to form a team out of nearly 23 similar players who all have similar strenghts and similar weaknesses but dont adjust to one another the only real players who play for the team  which means running chasing back chasing forward defend attack cross pass etc   players who work their asses of for the team  are messi obviously biglia and otamendi you see aguero standing around waiting for something to happen as he has not even the intention to win the game you got mascherano who maybe has the will but the physical side is just lacking   imo argentina will never win anything big in the next years because  when it comes to teamspirit to working your ass of for one another  they simply dont have the will to do this for each other Pretty accurate analysis of Argentina But a lot of fault has to lie with the coach then Talent is talent and having a ton of it is more good than bad   As somebody who watches a LOT of Serie A and Premier League I have to disagree a bit ,689,5,2

With Silva now cleared to play I think he is likely to get less game time and could provide cover for our aging defenders httpssofifacomsquad235825 check out my squad and leave a comment  I was dicking around in career mode and brought Iborra back to CB with Magiure they were amazing for me I had the best defense that season while playing on legendary I really dont understand the point in Iborra  hes not a defensive midfielder he makes an average of 24 interceptionstackles a game which is pretty unremarkable especially when compared with his teammate Ndidis 55 Nor is he much of a deeplying playmaker as he makes 18 long balls per game as compared with Xhaka and Shelvey  both of whom average above 41 long balls per game  which begs the question what does he even do?   He doesnt win the ball back very much he has a decent pass accuracy of 80 which is actually quite bad within the context of a midfielder who doesnt make many risky passes  long balls through balls key passes so I think that his passing stats are actually quite overrated Hes really not a very good passer at all it wouldnt be hard to justify 77 short passing and something like 74 long passing based off how hes played at Leicester this season   I suppose one thing that he has offered at other clubs is goals having scored a respectable 7 in the league for three consecutive seasons at Sevilla Regardless he is an extremely average player and I dont think that his stats accurately represent the kind of player he is his best asset is his runs into the box and finishing in addition to his physicality but hes not a good passer and hes not very good defensively Isnt he just a boxtobox midfielder? A more refined version of Fellaini lets say? Would be interesting to see how often hes used in link up play or as a target for a long ball I dont watch Leicester at all so Im just guessing here Are you on drugs? Not a good passer? He one of the most composed players Ive seen in a Leicester shirt great passing very calm on the ball keeps things ticking over But he doesnt 80 pass accuracy for a player who makes Conservative passes and usually passes sideways is bad his composure on the pitch and his ability to change the tempo of the game are both impressivehowever that does not influence his passing much considering he usually passes in a similar way Busquets does conservative but with worse pass accuracy Hes a more technical Fellaini Blokes a bit of a myth B2B  looks to get up and down the pitch but struggles with his lack of mobility and pace Strange doesnt win many tackles nor contribute much offensively Just a mere physical presence who may offer numerical security when he holds but overall quite a limited player Spanish Fellaini then how he doing at leicester?? really miss him He is a beast for Leicester Commands the midfield what leicester you watching ndidi controls midfield,226,0,3

Kindly respond if youre a constant watcher of Jamaal Lascelles Currently doing a lil bit of project regarding future Chelsea players If anything DM me on IG  chelsworldwide He can play a little bit but hes mainly an old school defender who just lives to defend his first thought is to clear the danger and when hes got the ball he doesnt want to drag himself away from his defensive position Hope this helps certainly helped me half a year later D how goodbad is his passing irl? As bad as the stats here say or? Probably a tiny bit better than his stats on here show but hes not really a ball playing type of defender hes more old school Is there any chance of him leaving Newcastle?

Bundesliga ,38.0,4.0,323.0,Arnold has always been overrated in FIFA  His long shots are heavy but really imprecise he hasnt been scoring regularly for years now  Long Shots should be around 80 or even below I agree with his longshots but I dont think he is overrated He plays in a different role nowadays He is much more of a deep laying playmaker I feel like this was one of his best seasons ever for us he really developed himself into a leader and certainly is a quality footballer He visibly is starting to hit his prime! 8082 I agree that this was his best season since like 201213 But I still think he has limited technique defensively hes also just average Leader? It seams his teammates have a different opinion on that he lost the captain position and he wasnt even voted in the squads player council although hes been in Wolfsburg way longer than Guilavogui and Casteels  I think this shows that his teammates dont respect him that much also in the two last season when we needed him and his long shots he hides away like all others no goals no assistance If my memory serves me right he never was captain and the old council voted the new one which were like Benaglio Gustavo and Naldo or so I dont remember our new squad had a democratic vote Regardless of that he is one of the most vocal players on the pitch with the referee and usually talks himself into kicking the freekicks He also is the longest active player for our club so I reckon hes pretty respected within the team I have no doubt that one day hell be captain  As for his stats he assisted 7 goals which isnt bad at all He is turning into a player like Toni Kroos not as good but from an attacking goal scoring mid too a deep laying long passing playmaker whos not particulary athletic or skilled on the ball but just has a very good left foot and vision and throws himself into every challenge that comes his way  He had disappointing 2 years like the rest of the club but really pulled himself back this year Well perhaps you should follow VfL more closely There was a council voting at the beginning of the season as one of the changes that had to happen in the team after two years of almost relegation Arnold was the captain in the second half of the last season but he wasnt even considered in the voting by his teammates even Knoche was voted into the squads council  This shows very bad leadership by Arnold Yes I agree this season was his best im years but in FIFA you have to consider the players history and not only hes current form   Arnold played two or three good seasons under Hecking he lost his place in the starting eleven to Luiz Gustavo and Guilavogui after that he never was as prolific at scoring goals and deciding matches as at the beginning of his career,2879,2,9

Should have around 82 pace His stats are extremly inaccurate 69 strength? Should be something like 8283 His defending is overrated af as well Since he has shitty stats on Fifa he fits perfectly with all the other Inter players lmao defending was one of his strengths at chelsea He hasnt played full back for almost 2 years and he wasnt even a defensive winger at all so defending should be in the mid to high 60s imo he had something like 90 ss and acc  Inter man  I wonder why Conte needs Moses when he has Lazaro and hes decent Lazaro didnt seem to fit in or basically needs more depth When you wanna manage you squad deeper! Nah forget what all these guys who never watch Inter say Lazaro is going to leave on a loan or even forever because he isnt quite ready to be a RWB yet and Conte wants players who he can trust to challenge for the league title I personally disagree with this strategy cause I think Lazaro has lots of potential but what can I do? Moses is likely leaving when the season is over You said exact same shit what i said  Well more or less Its not that were adding another player to have depth were actually replacing Lazaro with Moses Conte knows Moses from his Chelsea days If he was good enough to win the Premier League that year than he should still fit into Contes system Why are Inter buying him when they already bought Young? Young as lb  He was really bad for us but he will play better at Inter in my opinion Was he bad even at RMRW? Yep He only played well in Europa League games last year ,26,0,1

Hes like kongdobia with no brute strength at least feels like it IG Would love to see him at Werder Bremen Do you think itd be a realistic transfer? I spoke to a Werder fan when I started up my career and he suggested maybe looking at some Czechs Scandinavians and Americans to add to the little groups they have there already ie PavlenkaDrobnyGebre Selassie MoisanderAugustinssonBeijmo etc Ive already brought in Kaderabek to replace Gebre Selassie and Im looking at Barak Jankto and Sacek Rn it would only ne possible if one of our star players leaves for a relatively big sum eg Eggestein Klaassen Augustinsson or Kruse Werder definitely has a habit of wildering in smaller leagues like dutch scandinavian or eastern european but that seems to slowly change Sahin Möhwald Osako Pizarro Harnik Langkamp all came from Germany this season Thanks Im probably gonna to start a Werder career again in 19 as I didnt get very far in 18 I like to keep transfer targets and scouting policy as close to realistic as possible  Hi youre welcome  Im a longtime Werder fan so Ill go a bit further into detail We usually have 1 longterm ie 152 years loan of a promising talent of a top club eg de bruyne öztunali Friedl most of the time without an option to buy or a 1 season loan of a seasoned? player who has found himself on the bench or wants to leave with an option to buy ie Belfodil half of our transfer targets are unhappy players at good clubs klaassen sahin Langkamp the other half are promising talents from middle or lower leagues as you already described eg Rashica Sargent Augustinsson Pavlenka Beste Dont forget home grown talent tho! Both Eggesteins Plogmann Käuper as well as Mbom and Jacobsen have decent to fractional chances to sit on the bench or even play Maxi Eggestein as the most regular regular   BUT in recent times Bremen has really invested money and also in good players from good leagues so this trend slowly seems to change My tip Combine one or two high profile loans eg from Chelsea Loftus Cheek or Mason Mount with some promising talents and a seasoned player as well as nurturing home grown talents  Suggestions In the first season definitely another central defender is needed some young talent would be good here as Moisander and Langkamp are both 30 You might even want to replace Moisander its a bit unrealistic tho If you do get a CB with good passing Make a decision on whether Bargfrede is enough for you as a defensive midfielder as he is slow and not the best ingame very important irl tho and the mascot of the team so very unrealistic to sell rather keep him as a substitute if you are not happy with his abilities Buy a DM with interceptions and tackling as well as decent speed which seems to be lacking in midfield A good passing range would help too Think of arsenals torreira ofc not of that quality but with a similar skillset Otherwise the team seems to be well balanced except possibly for rightback where Bejmo has not proven yet that he is fit for Bundesliga Either recall Bauer from Loan or buy another backup if he is not enough for you  In the second season get another backup for leftback for when Friedl goes back to Bayern Munich and in case you sell Bauer who is unhappy irl and will most likely leave next summer If you didnt buy a rightback yet do so now Selassie is getting old ,329,0,2

But Selke used to play like that behind Di Santo then tall ass Johansson was dropped down the right wing Yatabaré was used as a winger too which was awkward asf lol Belfodil was too I dont know if its the best option but its a interesting style Stuttgart can play like that too with the many huge STs in the squad nah in the last years we hadnt tall strikers and I doubt that we ever used tall players strategically on the wings  ???

Bundesliga ,71.0,4.0,732.0,Yes but not genetically technically I understand what you mean though Just thought his genealogy was interesting wouldnt expect Angolan  Greek and Lazaro probably originally Lazáro is a Portuguese name He has a Portuguese name because Angola was a Portuguese colony still speaking the lnguage to this day Summer Interesting prospect and crucial player of Hertha BSC joins big club Inter lets give him 7579  Winter Lazaro joins Newcastle who had some problems the last years and were far away from international ambitions after Lazaro had no chance to get a place in Milan lets upgrade him to 7782  Like wtf? You do realise how position changes work right? If he was changed to a GK he would be 1114 Saw it after my post but still Why do they give him the position that suits him more after 6 fucking months and in exactly the moment where he joins BPL? The Inter editor was just shit at their job and didnt give him the correct position The Newcastle editor fixed it straight away Becouse he played RB at Hertha and he didnt play at Inter Potential is not affected by position change though 3 potential for PL move! I dont think so if they will change his position to rb or rw he will be 8079? it doesnt have sense I mean it does because it means his stats are more appropriate for a winger rather than a defender Also apparently the potential does change with the position if also the overall changes just found that out EA have no shame What an interesting time to get an upgrade! This isnt and upgrade they have just changed the position Which is still a nice and accurate update that he didnt get in the 6 months he spent with us  Also his potential was upgraded,2743,3,7

Not very great he has i think 2 or 3 goals Thats sad 7980 Thank god he isnt called up this time Bunch of Danish pricks sending him threats He missed a pen accidentally get over it Eriksen missed it as well and guess what it counted exactly the same as Jørgensens pen Christian should retire from the national team as well right? 1 that was not an accidental miss the keeper had practally already dived that way it was the same with Schönes pen 2 He has been shit for the last 18 months so thats why we hate him although i agree threating is over the line Well of course it was on accident he did not want to miss the pen he just took it terribly People are sending death threats to him,1409,7,8

Players of his kind tend to do fairly well here  Our defenders tend to be big and clumsy and dont deal well with wriggly dribblers like Giovinco and Pozuelo or poachers like BWP Martínez and Wondolowski  Honestly I think there are more reasons why players come over and do well beyond our league being of generally mediocre quality  BWP has said that he basically fucked off in England and started to buckle down when he had to come here Martínez was played out of position in Italy and my above point with Pozuelo Our league is also of generally mediocre quality well he only played for mediocre teams so idk if he turned it around really How exactly did he turn it around? First he played pretty well for Genk but of course only in the Belgian league which is far below the Spanish league in terms of quality And then he went to that exhibition league in the USA where defending doesnt exist and the most mediocre of attackers can look like Messi In the Belgian league he was amazing and really a joy to watch in each game he played He chose for the money during the year he had a huge contribution in Genk becoming champions going to Toronto  I think he would still be great for a midtable team in Spain or maybe even a subtopper like Villarreal For the Belgian league he was one of the very best midfielders ever played for our league He is way way waaaay too good for MLS 8081 absolutely sensational free kick he is pissing on the MLS He certainly seems to be making people forget about Gio and Vazquez!

Wait what 7880 He couldnt get in the Leicester side but is ever present for 1 of Germanys best teams  farmers league Everytime he played for leicester he looked quite good the only reason he didnt play was because of our managers reluctance to drop wes morgan Oh yes the great Pwemier League Best league from 2006 to 2016 because it was sooooooooooo ultra super duper competitive which was 1000000 NOT the result of the absence of an actual world class team while the Spanish league was a dull three team league best league from 2017 to now because ManCity and Liverpool are sooooooooooooooo good while Real and Barcelona arent even good enough to dominate the Spanish farmer league even though these two teams have won the last 5 CL trophies and because competitiveness of the league doesnt count anymore Its the best league but Spain has the best clubs How hard is it for you to understand that? Oh so Spains top clubs are better AND their league is more competitive? Makes sense Spanish clubs are better Englands league is better Realistic for Aston Villa in Premier League? Hes a good quality CB who looked at home in the Prem Shame that we chose to drop him simply because our captain was in the same position He wont really be missed for us as weve made CB signings but he would be a good signing for lots of teams irl and a realistic signing for lots of teams ig He is better than Wes Morgan now He was better than Wes at the time too Linked with Atalanta ,1331,2,4

Gaitan is one of the players that Benfica supporters love in my opinion he was one of the best players that played for us And he really enjoyed Benfica Porra ás vezes não entendo estes gajos And Gaitan was a Benfica legend Goes through the trouble of switching nationality to play for Portugal and three months later fucks off to China at the age of 29 because that makes sense Because the dude grew up in poverty and at the age of 29 he knew the importance of money you dumbfuck lol Well its not like hes a professional footballer who would be well off and able to support his family even without spending the next 3 years collecting fat paychecks playing in Mickey Mouse league Plus do you actually know how hard it is to get dual citizenship? He went through all of that to play for Portugal and a few months later goes to a league where hes never going to get a callup for as long as hes there I doubt he wasnt being paid enough at Braga Furthermore since his early 20s that hes being well paid so I dont understand why would he move now at his peak BTW he is returning to Portugal  His Side is relegated RN Paulinhos better He should be upgraded because hes started a new chapter of his career playing for the NT Do you even watch him play? He hasnt scored in 11 games now and he played like shit in both games for the national team I havent watched him for a few weeks but when I saw him last he didnt score but won the ball in the air every time it was played to im He has been playing like shit for a while now Bas Dost got downgraded for not scoring in 4 games and dealing with injuries Dyego hasnt scored in 11 games and still no downgrade What has happened to Paulinho? He was brilliant last season and Ive hardly seen him this season bro He was injured in the beginning of the season and lost his spot to Dyego but hes been playing better than Dyego recently Portuguese league is getting better bro and hopefully you can keep your best talent He should be downgraded Did he swap Brazil for Portugal because he might get a national call up? He swapped Brazil for Portugal because he got an actual call up solely from the national team games he is a physical merchant absolutely dreadful passing bad linkup awkward and sluggish movement im sure however if he gets a good chance to finish be it by foot or by head he can score easily,2387,15,15

Mostly on the wing but hes only actually played well on the 2 or 3 occasions hes played centrally  Thats where he was mainly deployed throughout his time in the academy once he got promoted it was wing wing wing Never suited him at all only seems to play good centrally otherwise he just looks average at Arsenal Sounds like that is whats happening at Everton right? This is what I was afraid would happen once Everton started playing him Exactly and you can tell that he wants to play centrally himself I was underwhelmed with the signing but from what Id seen of him I knew that if we converted him to CAM he could be a great signing but instead weve just carried on using him exactly as Arsenal did with the exact same underwhelming results  the fact that he is turning 24 now and this is still a problem kinda makes you think hes gonna pan out to be an average player i had huge hopes for him once he got promoted unfortunate 8488 future ballon dor winner  Just a shit player Expected him to improve with Everton So sad to see him like this  Still cant believe Everton paid 35m for this mug And they sold lookman and kept walcott consistently boring this season  ,1972,3,8

Yes Hes eligible to play for Jamaica Potential 82 84 I would really like for him to represent Jamaica We need another talented winger alongside Leon Bailey  Showing glimpses of getting improved coming into the game as a sub yet he is missing big chances every now and then He is Andros Townsend 20 I dont think he will ever reach this potential Max will be 78  Nice goal but hes not improved over the years Only legit move is the cut inside to the right from the left with the curler He has a bunch of potential  the pace is there the positioning but the end product is just poor  Im actually getting tired of saying he has potential Hes 22 years old  almost 23 ,1992,4,8

He just doesnt really excel at anything isnt very fast not very good attacking wise defensively average quite weak Hes just an ok player nothing more nothing less  Are you just saying he isnt fast because of his pace stats? In real life Chilwell is definitely fast Hes been a little inconsistent but certainly one of the best leftbacks in the league overall Most Leicester fans would agree with you He has been in a poor run of form since late December but in this time just about every Leicester player as but I think he is a solid player Though he needs to improve on his defensive side I think he would work better as a LWB in a 35 ATB I do think that he is the weakest part of the starting Leicester squad though Kasper needs to step it up as well but given his age I think he has time to improve especially defensively Leicester fans said his form has been dropped recently Watched him played against Southampton and I got to say its kinda true 82 How does he have the same rating and potential as Benjamin Mendy? Mendy used to be pretty good to be fair but yes Chilwell should be higher rated now This guy is overrated Leicester fans say it regularly they call him backwards Ben Because he passes the ball backwards in the final third Hes also not that great at defending either Telles is miles better and is Leicester can sign him they should definitely rob Chelsea Hes definitely not overrated He has 14 key passes per game compared to Pereira with 08 and 3 assists to Pereiras 1 so if theres any fans who think that their opinion really isnt justified  Haha if you think hes better than Pereira you know nothing about football people who watch him every week know hes very overrated overhyped player I didnt say he was better than Pereira but many of his stats are in fact better Ive watched him a lot myself so I know exactly how good he is and hes certainly a lot better than you seem to think but then you think Sterling is average so that tells me you dont know much about football He was poor against Aston Villa today Need to improve his defensively Update his face  ,3240,0,10

Lemar is actually a CAM whos used as a wide playmaker  i understand that but he has played the whole season as lm or lw Leipzig often plays a 4222 Two center mids two attacking mids and two forwards Nkunku has played mostly at LAM i know itll never happen but regarding Leipzigs System just imagine nkunku on the left and lemar on the right with Werner and Schick up Front boiii its a match made in heaven  Loll if Lamar goes anywhere its prolly Arsenal 8187 would be fair also 5 skills 808187 PSG has too much money yet sells Nkunku i like this lad hes a really good player and would probably work in a team like Arsenal under arteta or in Leverkusen if kai leaves PSG are forced to sell because players Have ambitions Staying in a farmers league wont further their progression they sold nkunku for 13mil thats nothing to them and nkunku could have been really sick with them instead of sarabia but thats just my opinion for him it was a great move and hes now finally been given the chance to play How is French league a farmers league at this point premier league is a farmers league toou200du200d Ligue1 is top 5 league in the world so if its a farmers league then there is no good players in the world just all farmers  That doesnt make sense at all You know that the richest person on earth has 3 times as much money as the second That means that the first is miles ahead but by your logic they are either both the same rich or none of them are rich  There can be huge differences between one place in anything  ligue 1 is one of the best in the world so how can they be farmers? What does that make leagues like the polish or Kazakhstan league ? Mega farmers ? Never said that they are farmers you mong  They are the 5th best league in the world easily I just clarified that ligue 1 isnt near to prem or the other 4 top leagues They are still very good and not farmers Eredivisie is farmers ,1153,3,11

Pandas are slow and take time to adapt to a new environment  8386?! Hes 27 next month and has one league goal all season He was on fire last year and the year before but yeah 8386 potential was overrated from day one He should get a downgrade in overall and maybe 1 growth would suffice  He scored 73 goals in last three years Yes he is having an off season but the rating was completely justified based on his performance last season For now a slight downgrade to 8285 would suffice His best season in la Liga was 17 goals and the Spanish second division is really not a strong league Youve got Vardy whos scored 91 goals in the premier league over the last 4 and a half seasons and is only rated 82 I would say 8183 is more than enough for him  Thats an unfair analogy Just because Vardy is underrated doesnt mean everyone should be Vardy should be at least 8585 maybe even 86 If we measure using that scale wed have to downgrade almost half of all strikers in FIFA I still think his rating is too high in general compared to other players Cant think of any strikers whove been given 83 in the premier league for so little Anthony Martial Martial has been in the premier league for 4 seasons and his record is decent in terms of goals and assists per 90 minutes but I do agree he is on the overrated side though 87 potential is a lot more reasonable than what he had before Kungfu panda 8285 ,3083,17,10

Class signing for SPAL considering they were in the 3rd tier 2 seasons ago Positioning 95 Finishing 50 What leads to this statement? I dont watch Calcio A but love him INGAME so I am interested in his career Heard he is in somekind of midcareercrisis do to the lack of playtime and success when he rarely plays I posted this because he made an amazing run from a set piece situation where he completely fooled the entire defense but then he shot it straight at the keeper Thats his problem I think he really lacks technical quality but his ability to time his runs is maybe the best in the world if Im to be honest He has had a lot of problems this season it was expected that he would be a protagonist for Atalanta this season because of how well he did at Chievo but in Gasperinis system he had to do a lot more on his own create his own chances run with the ball etc and he just isnt good at this in any way He cant really dribble his shooting isnt really that great either and just the overall lack of technical quality has made it very hard for him to link up with his teammates Eventually Petagna became first choice because he is great technically very physically strong and amazing at creating chances for himself and his teammates with his passing and dribbling which is incredible for his size Petagna is by no means a good goalscorer he doesnt really make the runs in behind and he can miss chances as well Paloschi may have scored more goals than Petagna5 this season if he got his amount of minutes and found some of his form again but he would never have the same impact in the team make the same amount of assists7 or create space for Kurtic Conti Gomez etc to score the amount of goals that they have Hard done by at Swansea His workrate and willingness to battle it out against the more physical CBs was certainly commendable Scored a decent amount of goals in the half season he got Not entirely sure why he got sold tbh  One of my favorite strikers in game! At one point in FIFA 17 he had nearly identical stats to Belotti but I prefered Paloschi over him since I dont like high defensive workrates on my forward The only thing that holds him back a bit is his lack of dribbling stats since he seems to be unable to keep the ball very close to his feet but hey since you dont want him to run out opponents and shoot from outside the box it should be fine He reaches almost every cross I send in and thanks to his top class positioning the low 77 in heading does not matter at all he scores the most beautiful headers ,851,2,5

Stamina should be at least in the high 70s something like 78 would reflect the reality much better And hes way stronger than 68 Id give him at least a 76 And upgrade his passing a little too Id love to see him being 77 rated Still ridiculously underrated by EA Whenever he is in one piece he is a starter and easily one of Werders most important and influential players all statistics including his goal impact rating back this up still he has a lower overall rating than the likes of Gentner Kohr Latza Skjelbred Schwegler Anton and Hasebe I dont even   78 overall at least with higher passing vision ball control and interceiption Also desperately needs one club player and team player traits 7777 hes a starter in nearly every game and plays very consistent plays more often then ever gets stamina downgrade but in the end its ok just the wrong time Just extended his contract! The game vs Wolfsburg alone merits 80 tackling he eas a beast but recent games would all merit an upgrade of the rating hugely improved the past couple weeks!! needs much more composure and passing plus interceptions stats ,1085,0,3

You compared quagriarella and jamie vardy with troy deeney?

The amounts of players youll develop into world class or just a level below talents is such a great prospect! It guarantees your career modes longevity as youre struggling to keep your best players while aiming for top 4s league titles European titlesetc I dont get why people say that Cms should be done with young high potential teams That is so boring Unless you want to get bored after Idk the third or second season when you win the CL dont go for such teams The most fun CMs will always be the ones where you are a selling club or a lower league side RTG If you do this CM that doesnt mean you need to sell every single player who gets a bid but be super realistic I guarantee you it will be so fun! Use players youve never used before bench or reserve players from this team who play good for you will be your hidden gems You can also go for ruined talent and try to get them into a good career I cant wait to get FIFA 20 so that I can do such Cms myself Once again do selling club saves theyre amazing ,3116,1,10

No So those speed record stats doesnt really tell about the players pace It does tho that is why pace is divided in acceleration and sprint speed A speed record is a way to tell a players sprint speed No they dont have to run for an entire hour the calculation is to see where the player peaked relative to pace instead of calculating how much distance a player would set in an hour Then why do some not so fast players also break speed records? And seems like ea dont consider those records neither You are naive to believe that EA actually puts out accurate stats They purposely give CBs lower pace compared to wingers and strikers If Varane wouldve been a striker they wouldve given him a pace like Aubameyang  This is their way of balancing a game where defending is already OP as fuck not that I agree with it but its just how theyve been going for the past decade I mean Varane is a perfect example he was outpacing players who were according to Fifa stats much faster then he is at the start of 2013 But it still took them 7 years to give him 80 pace Fifa stats are in someway relative to realism but they also take in consideration the balance of the game Soyuncu will just be like that he is extremely fast not to mention he was outsprinting Salah in 30m sprints So the speed record is relative to pace Forget about ea I know their way and i agree with you about that but thats not what we were arguing about Im not saying speed record is irrelevant Im saying it does not entirely tell about players pace If you think it does then you must think that çağlar should have 95 pace not 8183 I mean 95 is extreme but in my opinion he does deserve in the high 80s or even low 90s just think about it this way If he were a winger what pace would he have based on the sprints he makes? Not talking about any records just looking at the way he outpaces wingers like Salah that tells me how rapid this guy actually is But I do get your point the speed record is not decisive on its own 8288 When u look at him u think that hes a butcher  caveman  serial killer whereas hes very class and skillful on the pitch  And you get surprised when you hear his voice Sounds so thin and naive Also his words are so kind lol At least in turkish 8189 when he moves to a top club he will become a top class defender  8187 8185 ,371,0,2

The potential was because of the birthday downgrade he turned 25 and according to EAs logic a rightwing can not have 6 growth with 25 years Totally true Thats usually quite realistic too Furthermore its unfortunate for Costa that both Adama Traoré and Ivan Cavaleiro silently took his place in the lineup and share the wings with the very talented Diogo Jota So it seems Reclaiming his spot and performing on a high level could help Costa increase his overall rating and raise his potential for example Costa could go up to 78 and reach 81 potential But his age becomes a threat yes ,1345,1,5

Was he that selfish between July and October 2018? What had changed since then? The scouts and the concrete offers Wesley too When he played for the Dutch national team U21 he was in the same squad as Bergwijn and  he played a lot better than Bergwijn He has a lot of talent but he hasnt done shit since his injury last season Lol he deserves better than Bournemouth now look at him I told you he was not loved in the locker room has a lot of injuries and is just a player with some flashes of class  Jajaja terrible grone  Signed for Bournemouth exciting signing  I guess it is fun to play in a shitty counterattacking team So much fun ahead Bournemouth are a decent mid table team who play quite good football Glad he left though Krepinho is way better They mostly play in a counterattacking tactical set up with some pacey forwards King Wilson Scottish winger etc He would fit in the set up I think But still Bournemouth is the typical team that would collapse from one year to the next one and get relegated Bournemouth are far from a shitty counterattacking team theyre mid table mainstays in todays EPL I bet they will get relegated this season Actually youve got this very wrong In england Bournemouth are pretty well known for playing good football and not the hoofball brand that the Burnleys or Newcastles like to play,1174,5,9

Bundesliga ,36.0,2.0,667.0,He was one of the highest earning players on Frankfurts squad and he has performed no where near what he was earning He will reportedly sign with Hannover if he passes medical ah fair! remember him being brilliant back in my FIFA 15 career modes and thought he was on the cusp of the Germany squad a year or two ago was a good player with much promise but too much bad luck with injuries  last year he wanted to stay and try to win over the new coach which didnt work so this year after his deadline day deal with Hannover fell through Frankfurt released him from his contract so he could further negotiate with Hannover  What has happened to him? patrickbrischetto easy Injuries and new Coach Werder bremen should sign him as a replacement to Junuzovic Too good to not even be making the bench for some games If Joachim Low wants to keep his development going he ought to encourage him to leave Perfect replacement for Lallana Because hes injured all the time? Because i was talking about in game cool Still injuried? Back from injury and played really good! Needs way better defence stats but his passing is maybe a bit overrated his vision is very good but his passes bad CMCDM position I hope he gets playtime this season and can recover his brillant form from bevor his injury and can play next season without being injured His passes is bad ? Too many mistakes on easy passes Finally hes back  ,103,0,2

I was just saying  Because he has been very good and Turkey NT only has Caner Erkin Hasan Ali Ismail Koybasi Atilla Turan Emre Taskiran Eren Albayrak Omer Bayram and Sakib Aytac  Out of them I like Aziz Behich better!

Anyway Vossen isnt either strong or fast so he needs complementary players around him He does work hard and has a lot of football intelligence however Should go down a little in overall skills especially finishing Hes made 5 goals this season only 1 of them not a penalty  Missed loads of chances They got the penaltys upgraded now other shooting stats should slowly get downgraded like diaby last season As far as passingdribblingvision etc I think theyre still spot on True Hopelijk dit jaar Vossen samen met een andere spits op het veld in een 442 ,441,5,7

Al Ahli for about 3M Joind Al Ahli Been absolutely fantastic again today Should probably be highhigh with more vision Some changes might be needed based on the last game hes played Ive noticed his maximum sprint speed was not that high but that he makes up for that due to his attacking positioning and stamina It takes a while for him to reach his top speed but when he gets there he can keep running from one box to the other It has to be said that he will only do so if the positioning of other players in his team permits him to Always keeping an eye on everything and often hanging back to deliver a quick pass to switch play I think his acceleration should be downgraded but on the other hand is vision and short passing could use a slight increase as well ,2455,2,14

Not something that is easy to keep track of but I found Van Rhijns crosses far more dangerous last year best career buy ever! amazing on RB RM RAM RCM and even sometimes CDM hes a monster when he passes the 80 overal His crosses and passing are just not from this plannet then  only thing is he doesnt want to play anymore so i had to sell him because of his playing time he is a amazing sub for sure if a midfielder drops out or a back He can easy replace them so he always was my first choice sub   my career with DERBY  Mulder hateboer  Stephens  vd hoorn  Bryan Cools Davies  Sensi Kluivert  ambrose  boga  promotion team Deserves less agression less sprint speed but better short passing His sprint speed is fine His aggression on the other hand can maybe be lowerd by a few points And he is too inconsistent to improve his short passing to be honest Even though he used to be a CAM in youth leagues his short passing is not that great 71 is decent but its not better than that considering how many times he loses the ball because of sloppy passing Yet the passing is still good ENOUGH to be rated 71 because he CAN produces some excellent passes too Conclusion You cant increase his short passing rating unless he provides more consistent solid passing He definitely deserves high 60s in terms of pace he is always outpaced by any playoff 1 calibre winger very much like Obradovic Hamalainen Pocognoli    As to his aggression lol he is so soft he deserves low 60s at best for the moment ,342,1,6

Bundesliga ,5.0,0.0,43.0,So we can agree that the Wolfsburg editor is on crack right? He doesnt really deserve defensive upgrades but hes so good going forward and his stats should reflect that Higher dribbling ball control positioning and upgrades to various other attacking stats surely deserved Plus a potential of around 81 or 82 as a full back as others have mentioned Hes not a great defender but hes a very decent wing back I heard hes been excellent this season can anyone confirm that?  This is the most ridiculous rating in the whole team if this stays this way  Mbabu was baught to be the starting right back so far he completely failed to impress his trainer William played all games  7682  Mbabu should be downgraded to 75 since he played a not so good last season compared to two seasons ago Very underrated His stats showed he was one of the best RBs in Bundesliga I expect him to have a super breakout year with Wolfsburg this season For now 7882 would be perfect  Not the very best RB but he definitely shouldnt be rated 7479 Hes had a better second season without any doubt and theres been much improvement even though he does foul a lot Then again at twentyfour he has plenty of room to improve in every aspect as a defender especially now that theyre back in the EL I feel like 74 is a little low for him Yes he caused many penalties this season and his overall defensive IQ needs some work but going forward he is pretty good I guess his stats suggest that already so they are pretty spot on but he is a regular starter for a solid Bundesliga team this season I think he deserves a 75 or 76 rating with little upgrades in all his attacking skills like finishing He scored a couple of pretty nice goals this season like last weekend against Hoffenheim Aggression   httpswwwyoutubecomwatch?vhpHFsKwosng Aqui é inter porra!

IRL Agile and pacey winger with great scoring ability for his level Should be a good option for us as a backup winger Thats a very interesting analysis the stats suggest he will at least do the job as a rotation player for the attackers given his affinity for both scoring and assisting albeit he did it at a lower level which is nowhere near as intense as the BL    Do you think the club is doing enough to help you lot maintain that elite level displayed this past season given the fact that there will be CL football next season?

For the moment there is no reason he will not be a starter next season The club has no reason to replace him and buy another player After this we will have a new coach for next season and we have experienced players at his position with high salary He is better than them at the moment but he could easily be dropped if he does not perform So he will have to impress the new coach and keep up with his performances Thanks for the reply Right that is what I thought Especially didnt know what the situation is around Hilton or Congreif he will be a starter as a CB RBLB or whether he will be on the bench Also if they will stay or they will leaveor retire in Hiltons case Hilton does not want to retire and I dont think the club will let him go Still class even if he had bad games Congré is a problem  average and irregular with big salary so nobody will buy him He has experience and is liked by all the coaches  We also have Mukiele very good young player who perform as a rightback But he is initially a CB so maybe there is a project to establish Mukiele as a CB   After this maybe the club will not extend contract Hiltons contract will force Congré out Actually we dont know  But like I said if Pokorny keep up with his performances he will have no problem As you said from what I have seen Hilton is still performing really well It is cool that Pokorný can learn from him Ah okay didnt know that Congré is kind of shaky especially in the matches Ive seen him in,1333,0,8

Ive played with him with the Russian NT in the years 2021 and 2022 so he grew in his natural potential because I did not have him on my actual club He is such an amazing crosser and his corner are deadly as well Almost every sling he gives is a shot header on goal even with players like Kokorin and Smolov which arent the best headers of the ball of course Also his free kicks are decent And not to forget he is pretty fast and he can defend nicely enough Thanks man Sounds perfect to me hes got great physicals and mentals as well as crossing and his defending can be easily trained    Did you notice what kind of natural growth he gets? Is it a ton of speed and strength aggression mostly tackling crossing and curve etc? Or is it well balanced? 7585 What do you base this on?? He just now made his first minutes for Vitesse?

Im surprised Rada got the call although I havent seen him play much before so I cant really comment on him Otherwise both Horava and Frydek should be there Its so obvious that Vrba dislikes Horava who I think is one of the best central midfielders in the Czech league Once again Kolar will likely play as the number 10 which inspires no confidence at all You mentioned Cermak but theres also Soucek too I think those two could easily be in the A team already Very exciting talents And yeah Petrak was a beast at the U21 tournament Such a shame he couldnt put it together this year Looked far better than Vacha  I am watching Rada closely since he was captain of a reserve team in Sparta Really good player Great skill good technique impressive in set pieces wonderfull ball control rarely loses a ball good long shot strong in tackles and interceptions Sometimes holds ball for too long but always tries to find creative and football solution rather than just get rid of it and get rid of responsibility Will be a good addition and will be interesting how he will handle it Completely agree with you about Horava and Frydek As Vrba said 3 players will be selected additionalyCB and probably 2 offensive players most likely CDM and CAM The player I miss the most in nomination is Kovarik though His crosses are unbelieveable and he deserves to get a shot Even though there is already Krejci on left side and Skalak and Sural both able to play there So I think as a CB he will choose between Baranek Brabec or Hubnik and on the other two positions I guess it will be a choice between Frydek Pospisil Vacha possibly maybe Marecek and hopefully Kovarik but I doubt that From what it looks like Dockal will be on the wing which is bullshit Played there last three games and struggled there Especially against Jablonec and Lazio If Dockal would play CAM in NT this time as well and where he plays most of the time in Sparta at least Kolar wouldnt be a starter and additionaly one player on the wing would be available to receive additional callKovarik or Frydek etc It is a shame that Kolar is Vrbas favourite and on the other hand Horava complete opposite The only thing about Horava is that he is physically weak and lacks pace a bit but other than that he is a great all around player,1441,0,5

Seriously Fifa? He is a real goal machine! Look at his stats hes got the best positioning and finishing in the league Ok but imho he should come out as one of the best 7576 ovr in the league His physical stats especially strength and jumping are a bit too low Furthermore he has been useful while holding the ball away from the defenders in order to let his teammates come upfront to attack so 61 at ball control is a harsh rating 6769 would be fine I mean he isnt certainly world class but this season he has been doing great things Anyway I would love to know your opinion since I noticed you are probably belgian  I dont think he should have such a high overall because that would mean hes a great overall striker whereas in reality he is quite limited Hes an amazing goal scorer with a great sense of positioning but hes not capable of relaying the ball like Depoitre would do or do a 60 meter run and dribble past 3 opponents like Diaby would do He deserves his stats and they really are quite high Hes the player with the lowest overall rating in the game to have 86 positioning AND the player with the lowest overall rating to have 83 finishing This means that his stats are exceptionally high for a player with his rating Scored a brace today This guy has such a high chancetogoal conversion rate its crazy Upgrade finishing to 80 at least Scored 3 goals in the last 3 matches hes still got that magic goalscoring touch Apparently they listened to you  Well deservedly so this guy is the most lethal striker in the Pro League Back in Belgium!

He left when he was 19 back in 2007 I dont think one can compare the player he is now to back then Hes still at a decent age Just look at his Stuttgart days then! Besides Inter as a whole has been rather woeful since Mourinho left Dear Jappi you often overrate swiss Football a bit! There is still a lot between Inter and Basel! Stay realistic and look at the Players and the infrastructure etc And by the way His Performance against Leverkusen was very good! Hes a leader and he can bring some creativity in the game He was playing very well up till now I have to say But I mean that atm in a match between Basel and Inter there would be no favorite if you get what im saying Of course Inters money and infastructure is nothing compared to Basel I think you mean the other way around Basels money and infrastructure is nothing compared to Inter!? Yeah exactly although slowly the infastructure is catching up Overall the niveau will never be the same due to the superior league tho Was quiet possibly the worst player ever to put on an Inter jersey Thank God he left Your whole team is wank Your mum loves to swallow whats your point? I give up Lol Zahavi lol We might not be playing in Europe this year but thats miles better than going out of the Champions league against Maccabi Tel Aviv no disrespect towards Maccabi All disrespect meant towards Basel theyre Swiss Everyone knows Swiss people are evil  We played shit but Maccabi is a fucking disgrace of a team basically just tried to injure Basel players and then scored 3 lucky goals out of 3 shots And the ref was obviously corrupt in the first game  call it an excuse I call it a disgrace No Im afraid to say you might be very wrong There have been far worse players over the years At least Kuz gave everything every single time he played,651,1,8

He actually should have a slight upgrade in crossing and long passing  Appropriate downgrades would have been in acceleration speed agility balance and reactions but not his defensive stats  httpcelticbynumberscomipagecomistoljananupgradeonlustig surely his days must be numbered at celtic now he has cost us far too many big goals the past few seasons especially in europe why rodgers continues to select him over gamboa is beyond me Cause Gamboa is useless 7575 for FIFA 19 consistent on his world cup performances already is as a CB and thats only where hes usable due to pace Lmao his sucking off Neymar now?

Hes rated 76 now Griezmann 92 Koziello 87 Varane 92 Dembele 92 Sarr 88  Obviously its only on FIFA Most of the players may not get there same with players of other nationalities France just seems to have the largest pool of talented players  Its mostly because Ligue 1 players get a lot more playing time as teenagers but ea also massively overestimate the ceiling of these players I think France do just about have the most talented young players but England and Brazil arent far behind in real life,705,0,3

Linked with Olympique de Marseille ide like to have more informations about this player very fast quite technical good crossing  extremely good work rate Hes more of an attacking wing back and even though he has improved defensively this year he still struggles sometimes For sure he can stand in all Ligue 1 lowmidtable teams not really sure if he is at a top5 level though obviously I exclude PSG he is definetly not for that level Good choice for 57m but I doubt we will sell him for less than 10    in my opinion he is better than Masuaku who was his predecessor in Olympiakos and he looks set to replace Masuaku at West Ham amid interest from Pellegrini  Masuaku is more skilled but Koutris is way more aggressive and determined on the field Both have issues defensively though Koutris must do a lot of work in that area if he wants to play in the Premier League He plays only 2 years in Olympiakos meaning at ChampionsEuropa league level and last year we were horrible I believe it would be better if he stayed another year here and work with Pedro Martins who turned out to be quite a good manager Linked with Marseille No idea of his levelstyle This needs to be updated asap He can become a very big player as he is already a very good LB He is a 7577 now for sure Underrated ,1508,0,8

And as to Gano and Morioka they both went to teams at the wrong time as when they arrived both Oostende and Anderlecht were in full crisis mode Also very important to note that the entire WB midfield revolved around feeding the ball to Morioka and allowing him to do what he wants with it thats why he had two strong and defensive mids right behind him whereas now Morioka is just one of the midfielders and cant claim the ball like he used to I know I know just noticed they were now underperforming compared to their form WB Ive heard Genk fans complaining about Seck by the way because theyre used to more technically gifted midfielders and Seck relies more on his physique I know these WB players very well and Im aware of the difficult circumstances those players went to Thats why Id always advize Morioka to finish the season excelling WB in order to secure his place in the national team The entire WB team was built around him while HVH just puts players in His Holy 3421 System regardless of whether they fit in or not HVH doesnt adapt to his players they need to adapt to him Thats why he failed Genk earlier I suppose I hope get gets a potential upgrade 7177 Linked with Anderlecht Underestimated player Excellent target man pretty nice goal yesterday Why the downgrades?

Watching it since I can remember  But watching football in general is great Im sure you think so too There was an item on Extra Time yesterday that specifically highlighted his amazing work rate and stamina Ive already said this 3 months ago he really needs a big stamina upgrade As well as a big sprint speed upgrade I have to confirm your observations In the past he was very insecure about himself how he played All he did was focus on what he did wrong Yet now hes opened up Hes taken himself to another level as a leading pawn in the so far rather successful season of KVO Hes swift turns incredibly fast has the vision and technique to produce excellent passing and has grown another set of lungs this season What I do want to add is that he should also have the trait diver Yes he is being fouled a lot but in recent figures it turned out hes the player who hits the ground the most in the entire JPL Like Jakob said this guy needs a stamina pace and vision upgrade Was MotM alongside Cyriac today He was amazing yesterday Should get a stamina upgrade work rates high high and a sprint speed upgrade he looks like a pedophile This guy needs an upgrade  70 overall  79 potential and 70 stamina,2071,4,2

NSakala Büttner JLukaku Safari Odoi   because played sometimes LB instead RB Diogo Lecjaks All these played supposed to be better than Deschacht failed while Deschacht played LB  because of coach? Not really 45 coaches have preferred him to these players The thing is now and last season he wasnt at his level he had and people keep saying he always have been badnot good for Anderlecht but the fact is hes always here despite of all these LB recruited You make a good point but to answer that question we need to assess how good his competitors at LB were I mean out of all the names you just listed there wasnt one LB in there who was Vanden Borrelevel quality and talent Some players you were just plainly played out of position I mean Lukaku an LB? hes really an LW maybe a LM or already hasbeens Büttner Thats true too but Lecjack was supposed to be a big hope for his country like Safari was They didnt impress a lot I think the only thing we can say here is that the scooting wasnt perfect Van Holsbeek made 7080 terrible signings last years I think the problem is that Anderlecht relies too much on transfers they should be relying on youth players Nearly all their best players from the last years have come straight from their youth squads Dendoncker Tielemans Lukaku Vanden Borre Kompany notable exceptions include Mitrovic Biglia Suarez They should be focusing way more on launching new young players from their youth squads They should then only buy veteran players who are past their prime but are still good enough for the JPL or good players from lower level Pro League teams I mean honestly I dont see why Anderlecht would want to make huge transfers like they did for example Mitrovic They dont have the budget to compete with Europes top teams so why even try? I totally agree with you before hatchings of Lukaku Praet Tielemans Dendoncker Anderlecht had the possibility to launch young purple talent like Januzaj Musonda Mertens Fellaini   But it wasnt the vision of the club and they all gone except Musonda family because of attractive money from Chelsea  The big issue was Van Holsbeek his vision of scooting was terrible now I hope Devroe will be better than this last one and try to make less transfert but with a better quality I think recruiting Dimata Vranjen Didillon from what I saw during amical games he was pretty interesting In addition of some unknown promising young talent like Adzic Abazaj Ilias In addition of that 2 last years Anderlecht had some financial issues they had to fix before sale the club which may explain the lack of good signing 2 last years Even if it got a good impact about hatching new purple talents like Saelemakers Sambi Amuzu to say major names And perhaps Bornauw this year? ,2160,2,5

And now I really think he just saw it coming Maybe its the same for Geubbels and Maolida Geubbels and Maolida and some top talents not only in the Lyon setup but in French football setup with the u20s letting them go right now looks desperate and depletes the team of quakity in depth given how inactive aulas has been in the window Aulas night well be the end of Lyons competitve stint in the top 4 last 3 seasons Hopefully both kids pan out and reach their potential unfer managers that love youthJardim and Vierra Ben Arfa was even a bigger youngster he might have looked even more desperate but looking back at it it wasnt a bad move to sell him Ben Arfa is the living tagline of the movie What couldve been if attitude was betterstarring Mario Balotelli  Considering Nice hace put a 100M release clause in his contract shows how much faith they have in his abilities I dont thing you get what Im saying Lyon believed in them too But to decide to sell them because they had no urgency to sell them there is probably something Something like when they sold an other talent with huge potential This might not be a hazardous sale They know they have huge potential Fair point I want to cry ,957,0,5

Hes a fairly solid player and will be one of our only experienced PL players in a position we are massively lacking in depth? I dont think theres a villa fan out there that wouldnt take this guy over Neil Taylor The problem is paying 17 million for a guy that struggled to get into a Southampton side that was battling relegation all season I dont doubt the potential this guy has I would have preferred someone with a bit more pace though Both Targett and Guilbert arent the fastest of wing backs and if this guy flops its a lot of money pissed away that could have been better spent elsewhere Especially when you consider were reluctant to pay the 25 million for an international GK in Butland but will happily spunk 17 million on this guy Only time will tell I suppose also the only player weve signed with premier league experience at the moment Hes better than Taylor so I think a lot of people will agree with you Is he worth 14M?

Every fucking game he played in the last year and a half Whats the point in upgrading a player after he played 1 decent game in 6 months of mediocrity? Ill be happy to see him upgraded after he will have played well for at least a month  And thats just for him to go back to his September stats 6 months of playing well? Then maybe we can talk about the numbers you proposed  Look i dont care if hes potential is 84 but hes overall need to be upgraded to 80 or 81 as he is performing better for the past 3 matches in Hertha then he did in Milan plus the Milanese fans were never on his side to help him mentally which shows their low class Oh yeah of course Lets insult the Milan fans What the hell do you know about the Milan fans?   The upgrade that you are proposing is simply out of this world he was not upgraded to 81 after last year Do you know how many goals he scored last year? 30 After 3 moderately good performances and 1 goal you are proposing to give him the same overall as Poulsen or even worse Richarlison Please  And btw we supported him and waited for him to show up for months he didnt even put effort into it I am salty towards him because its all his fault if he failed this year  He did not put the work in during the summer showed up in a very bad form struggled and lost his winning mentality and got himself into a loop of mediocrity out of which he will very difficulty come out as the same player that he was last year  Last but not least I would really like to know what stats and by how much you would improve them Sorry I lost my temper but calling me and the other AC Milan fans low class is not exactly friendly behavior  Its fine to be salty to a player whos not performed to his last seasons high but fans calling his human garbage is too extreme and Im not saying all did this but Ive seen quite a lot of them doing this and worse,2973,22,10

Any chance he could get shit back on track? Few things  1 Broke his foot as soon as he arrived at Stuttgart and was immediately out for the season that probably destroyed his entire career 2 Very tactically limited player can basically only play a Messilike winger or as a false 9 3 Extremely weak and short and not cut out physically for bigger leagues  guys like Giovinco are exceptions but most people of Marcos stature wont make it 4 He was benched for his entire time at Heerenveen which never allowed him to show what hes capable of  Hope this move lets him show what he can do had a 75 rating at the start of FIFA 18 so as you can hopefully tell hes not that bad lol Not even playing him anymore!

BTW the entire Polish League is underrated I guess Maczynski is underrated but Polish League is a big shame for Polish people because of impossibility to qualify for Champions League Last team in CM was 20 years ago Widzew Lodz Thats really a shame and a bit unlucky tho But anyway some teams actually would welcome upgrades Wisla Krakow Pogon Szczecin Zaglebie Lubin and Piast Gliwice to name a few and they would be deserved! And of course the players called to the Euros especially Maczynski and Pazdan who are playing quite well Haha so underrated holy shit Used to always sign him for my lower league careers in FIFA 15 cause he was a free transfer who could go from 68 to waaaay past 70 despite 69 being the limit Fun to see him playing in the Euros now Should be at least 72 Very good performance against Northern Ireland He sees a lot on the pitch and plays with great tranquility despite the high pressure A lot of key passes and quite good tackles One of the leading players of the match next to Kapustka and Glik IMO where Bartek Kapustka was the best yesterday I wish them good luck at thursday against Germany ,1553,1,6

Yea mate Im a Forest fan since long ago but Im not from England so Im not that familiar with the championship or lower divisions Ive been getting more into it the last years but Im still kinda lost with some teams and traditions I really rate the blades for what u achieved tho And I agree hes not PL quality but maybe could help Forest get to  the top 6 this year The championship is the most underrated league in the world and it is starting to get more high profile Notts Forest are pretty much in the same boat as Leeds United in the way they are a massive club stuck in the 2nd division Forest spent a hell of a lot of money last season and should have done better They should definitely looking to finish top 6 next season and Gallagher would be a good signing but I would take him to the Blades for back up only I really like the championship is there a forum or some website where I could go and learn more stuff?   I think the problem with Forest was that Karanka was sacked way too early he was building a philosophy httpwwwforestforumcoukforumdisplayphp?f6 Try that bro we have 1 for the Blades and its pretty much spot on with fans sharing views and some users have contacts close to the club or know staffplayers that feed them info on the in goings and out goings Now that we can train stregnth im gunna train him up in that and short passing English Giroud boy if you could train jumping aswell what a beast he would become 64 doesnt need much jumping You could try to glitch him tho still though i like the thought of having 64 or 65 tall players with around 80 jumping and great HA httpssofifacomplayer226299bryanrochez19159359  This mans a monster Wins every cross into the box Scored 50 goals over 2 seasons 1 Liga Adelante 1 La Liga Got him up to a 78 in 2 seasons with Depor then sold him for 25m  Replaced him with httpssofifacomplayer215061?v19e159359settrue,30,0,1

Hes pressing the opponents defense for 90 mins every time he gets to play a full game Is his best attribute by far and hes actually been scoring this season  7580 Lmao From his time at APOEL I think that his biggest assets were his physical qualities sprinting staminahelping defensively strength and jumping as well as the fact that he had been heavily involved with chances in the box He rarely goes quiet attackingwise  However I feel that he was lacking in Finishing and in his Technique His firsttouch can be magnificent at times for example controlling difficult crosses down to the ground but it is very inconsistent and may look sloppy at easier circumstances His Dribbling isnt that good as well  I dont watch him at Copenhagen but if he improves in those two areas then he can be a top top player with his overall attributes If not he is already a good player like that  Youre spot on mate His jumping strength stamina and speed is great for a target man but his heading accuracy is quite bad and he needs to score more His first touch is almost amongst the best in the league really good at taking the ball down but hes definitely not the type of player to create his own chances by dribbling a defender or two He works hard and that goes a long way in our 442 Im sure the goals will come eventually I REALLY wanna like this guy He has such a good attitude cries after a lost match So much heart But hes just not that good Fucking terrible lately 7377 was really good w APOEL Ball control to 73 decrease head accuracy Wait what hes sick in the air! Hes Strong jumps High but always misses goals on headers Amazing first touches though Based off todays game against OB his heading accuracy may be a little too high tbh Should be 70 IMO ,896,2,7

From his 23 appearances I can assert that he lacks some football fundamentals Ball control crossing first time passing he is way below the average level of the starting players Disappointing Still waiting for Lazovic How certain is Lazovic coming anyways? there is no certainty in that at all  I am just awaiting a new or even 2 arrival on these two wing back positions Hes more like Cools than Limbombe Great at long passes and early crosses Interesting story behind this transfer KV Mechelen bought the guy thanks to Club Brugge They scouted him  but didnt have room for him in the past So they decided to share the information with KVM They werent even planning on buying him at first But in the end of course that gesture in the past made this transfer A LOT easier  Of course Ivan Leko is Croatian that added to the motivation to join a team but  the one man who convinced him Club Brugge was the right club was Ivan Perisic himself Wanted by Club Brugge I Would rather go for Lazovic tbh I understand Lazovic looks way better but they already have a personal agreement with this guy  Hes probably A LOT cheaper Has signed for Club now Yup signed for 35 years,157,0,2

An absolute yes so far! We were rock bottom before he came joined the starting XI and after that we havent conceded too much from open play and are slowly climbing the ladder I read he won about 94 of his duels so far only netting 2 yellow cards in like 10 games or someting Needs to implement his build up play and awareness during setplays still concede too much via setplay but given this guys age its a positive surprise for me On this video he seems to be confort on the ball and alright in the build up play as well httpsvimeocom313786352  Does he have leadership trait ? Okay but these are highlights I watch him every week Hes sometimes able to run past defenders on his own half purely cause of his intimidating presence and determination He however sometimes struggles when pressed by forwards himself and is a bit too onefooted That 2 star weak foot is about right   As for leadership qualities Id say those go to his compatriot in defense Te Wierik Chabot hasnt been very outspoken and just does what his job is on the pitch but he does it so damn well! ,2320,1,10

Maybe if money is the 1 thing he values? Like way above everything else? May be because hes a footballer I believe Saudi Arabia are also traditionally quite strict on giving people Saudi citizenship who havent born and grew up in the country but footballers can get it easily to supplement a weak national team finally completed his move to Chinawould be interesting to see if he also pledges international allegiance to China Would surely be the first black player to play for them He never recovered its bein down hill but this is rock bottom welcome to Guangzhou Evergrande 数值居然不还如冯潇霆张琳芃李学鹏 Hes about to become a naturalized Chinese citizen when he signs for Guangzhou Evergrande Will be able to play for the Chinese national team in the future!

Dude got an xbox gamertag as his name That stamina downgrade o bad thing is it is probably right  en 2015 es diestro Man utd bought him in my CM It would be fantastic if MPH actually puts him on the pitch  On the other hand Izquierdos pace is unmatched Gedoz always manages to create opportunites Rafa is probably the most technically gifted player of them all and Diaby actually scores atm Yeah and theyre all pretty good on their own Its just pretty difficult to fit them all on the pitch Felipe had a game last week so Rafa could take a break and it has been quite a while since Felipe had played that long in a game I do wish Tuur gets more time as well but for now hell have to do with the few minutes he gets When we need him hell be there rearing to get some balls into the back of the net! I dont think he will ever achieve an 80 potential I think he could look at his stats he has one of the best goalassist ratios in relation to time on the pitch in the entire league It frustrates me that PreudHomme doesnt start him more often Preudhomme should give him more credit Gedoz and izquierdo were just horrible yesterday And against Westerlo with a bteam come on But I think hell reach his ceiling soon 78 would be correct for him imo Why would you think hell reach his potential soon? Its not like we have a lot of perfectly twofooted wingers around who are really goaloriented True dat But Preudhomme will have to give him opportunities And its just a premonition that hell reach his potential soon Looks like youre right  Finally! will be more fun to play with him in career!

O Jorge teve 2 épocas no Mónaco A 1a jogou pouquíssimo foi de adaptação A 2a fez 28 jogos mas nunca chegou a convencer verdadeiramente pelo menos a mim Nos jogos que fez pelo Porto que foram poucos mas aí tb culpo o SC que roda muito pouco a equipa tb não mostrou nada de extraordinário Sabese que tem um clausula de cerca de 10M de euros e é 999 certo que o Porto não vai pagála O João Pedro até agr tb não se viu nada de especial apesar de ter melhorado ligeiramente quando começou a jogar pela equipa B  O Manafá fez uma excelente 1a metade de época no Portimonense É definitivamente uma das revelações da nossa liga Beneficia tb de ser polivalente o SC adora a polivalência xD pois pode jogar a DD DE ED EE Pessoalmente é um jogador que me faz lembrar o Ricardo Pereira e o Bosingwa dada a sua velocidade e capacidade de cruzamento Pareceme uma boa contratação do nosso clube Eu também tenho as minhas dúvidas sobre o Jorge mas acho que já devia ter tido mais oportunidades O Alex Telles tem vindo a demonstrar bastante cansaço e está em risco de lesão Sem jogar também não se vai afirmar Já mostrou muita qualidade pelos escalões inferiores da Seleção Brasileira e pelo Flamengo Quanto ao João Pedro já mostrou mais que o Jorge na equipa B e principal parece muito mais esforçado o que também pode fazer a diferença nestes casos Já deveria ter sido utilizado mais vezes visto que o Maxi é uma nulidade nem ataca nem defende bem O Manafá está a fazer uma boa época e realmente o seu estilo de jogo é parecido com o do Ricardo também têm em comum a versatilidade mas veremos como se safa defensivamente Não digo que não seja uma boa contratação e até pode superar as expectativas mas acho que não é melhor que os outros dois posso estar enganado e espero estar ,2155,3,12

Hahahahhha thats a joke vague memories of this guy playing for ajax and being a complete beast in like fifa fourteen or something Should maybe start doing javelin throw instead of football O 6468 Underrated! I see every game he plays and he is definitely 6667 in overall and a potential of maybe 7374 He had a rough time while cut from Ajax and it has taken some time to get him going but I he improves in every game Lets say in Swedish preseason he was 63 since he was so out of form he has worked himself back up to 67 IMO Still fighting for a place in the team but he was one of the better players in Malmös previous Champions League qualifier He needs time on the field man Disgusting how midEurope treats talented young players  Should have 50 finishing imo And 4555 strength His finishing is pretty shit Great positioning though  finally they got the money to pay for his flight ticket to Malmö ,1789,7,10

His first ever start was against Milan his favorite team he said the other 3 games he came off the bench Was actually the best player on the pitch that day too Inter There is absolutely no way he is 18 I hear people say black people look older but just please This guy is 25 minimum I swear They said Franck Kessie was older too but that turned out to be bullshit The stress of a shitty life ages their faces beyond their years Juventus are reportedly close to a deal for Pescara midfielder Mamadou Coulibaly They missed Verratti one time so they dont want to miss the new Verratti this time haha Id bet my left nut that 03021999 isnt his real birthday Look further down the page  There are tens of methods to find out the real age and most of clubs does that a simple XRay Exam could easily reveal your age blood tests are enough to reveal you both chronological and biological age We are after him and I dont think JMedical will not take into consideration such hypothesis after all there are a lot of similar cases but to be honest Africans have a really superior bodyagewise and tend to be way better developed physically than others Yes Africans tend to hit puberty earlier and have a higher testosterone count than Europeans  But it just so often happens that African talents never develop they are physical and powerfulexplosive with usually one skill set that is very developed usually dribbling or tackling But basically always they lack the tactical understanding and technical finesse to become great players Godfred Donsah for example 2 seasons ago he was hyped as the next big thing linked with Juve Roma etc He hasnt moved at all he cant really establish a place in the Bologna team because the midfield is out of balance when he plays  When I look at Coulibaly play I dont see a player that will develop particularly much and I think Juve would be a making a big mistake if we end up paying a couple of millions for him Hes an amazing guy IRL!

FIFA only allows teams to have a certain number of loanees so lower overall players outside of that number are automatically assigned as permanent to the team they are on loan with I wonder what the hype is about He is 21 years old which is quite old for a future prospect and hardly got some playing time Play Off 2 is some sort of Ersatz competition in which clubs tend to experiment with youngsters He performed decently in the time he got but didnt really stand out either Frankly his current 11 growth potential looks even quite generous for a CB his age Wasnt this kid a future world beater according to some americans on this site? Yep he has a similar ceiling to CCV and has held his own professionally thus far He just turned 21 and will be playing in the Everdise next season it looks like on loan 6781 Worked his way into the starting lineup for a team that has nothing to play for  Could be playing their own youth instead  in only a few months Has looked solid during his gametime too 6781 No way hes a 81 I watch the Belgian competition alot and he isnt something special Altough he has only played for like 6 months and he still has to adapt to the game and environment he really doesnt impress so much 6876 is more fair IMO If youre looking for a promising American defender you should have a look at Miazga The guy is a great player and is already one of the better defenders in the eredivisie Also hes a freaking awful player very dirty habits Haha no Id rather see him move to Europe and struggle than see him wasting his potential and valuable time in the cest pool that is American Soccer This seemsextreme Someone who actually watches all his games is this deserved? His loan was kind of a tough situation because his club is fighting for a Europa league spot He had a few subs and played pretty well in them I watched his start the other day and he had a good performance Looked comfortable on the ball and solid in defense he is on right now if you want to watch him I thought 82 was a bit high initially but anything below 80 is criminal ,1576,1,2

Good question First of all I have to admit that this rating does not reflect reality He is definitely an interesting player with a huge potential Has good speed is really strong great with the ball and in last few months he has also improved massively his finishing He is a reliable goal scorer He is able to be in multiple scoring chances per game On the other hand he still wastes some of them If he would score at least from the clearest chances he would score a goal in each game So there is still room for improvements in his finishing Vallah ne mal yönetim  Savunma ve forvet en önemli mevkiler futbolda ve bu mal yönetim iki genç ve deneyimsiz oyuncular alıyor şampiyon takımın anasını s Hiç alakası yok Yönetim Terim in onayı olmadan kimseyi almaz bugün dünya yıldızı olan bütün futbolcular zamanında genç ve deneyimsiz oyuncular oluyor Terim gibi bir hocanın elinde çok büyük çıkış yapar GS nin transfer politikası bence doğru ve GS ye ileride büyük kazançlar sağlayacak 33 yaşında koşamayan adamları alıp  bir dünya para bayılıp sonra zorla yollanmasından bıkmadın mı? Elinde Gomis olsaydı anlardım Tettehyi almamız çünkü iyi forvetler ile oynarken genç oyuncular deneyim kazanıyorlar ve uzun vade için iyi bir transfer olurdu Tetteh şimdilik Galatasarayın ilk forveti olamaz çünkü hem deneyimsiz hem gerçek seviyesini bilmiyoruz Lig başladı bile hemen ilk 11de baslayabilen bir forvet bulmamız şart  Dediğim gibi forvet ve stoper mevkileri çok önemli futbolda öyle bilmediğimiz genç oyunculara güvenmemeliyiz Ne transfer politikası ? Adamlar bütün iyi oyuncularımızı gönderdiler Gomis Serdar Aziz Garry Rodrigues yerine sadece 3 savunma oyuncusu aldılar zaten ikisi çöp Emre Tasdemir ve ömer ve Emre Akbaba Zaten Badou ve Henry kiralık Yani hem hücum hattında hem orta sahada takviye yapmak zorunda kalacak Galatasarayın sezon sonu Birde bu beceriksiz yönetim Belhandayı Marianoyu Feghouliyi ve Maiconu satmayı düsünüyorlardı Tetteh in o potansiyeli yok diyosun nereden biliyosun? youtube da 35 dk video izleyince kötü mü oluyor? bu adamlar scoutlar tarafından aylarca izleniyor kaldı ki bugüne kadar terimin yaptırdıgı potansiyeli yüksek transferlerden hangisinden zarar ettik yada tutmadı? hepsi tuttu ha bu arada tetteh in yanına deneyimli forvet lazım diyosun ya bir tek deneyimli forvet olunca mı kendini geliştirecek bu adam? koca GS de 1 tane forvet geliştirecek yönlendirek adam yok mu? işte esas senin bakış açın çok yanlış klüpler bu yüzden batıyor çünkü güvenmiyor yok bu adam yapamaz diyormarcao içinde aynı şeyler söyleniyordu evet ama ankaragücü maçı bi referans olmasada adamın kumaşı iyi ve bunu gösterdi kendini dahada geliştirecek ve minimum 1213 milyon euro ya satacagız gibi geliyor iyi oyuncu dediğin rodrigues geçen sene cok iyiydi evet ama bu sene bitikti bi yarım sezon daha satmasak 5 milyona bile satamazdık bu 1 serdar aziz dediğin adam GS ye geldiğinden beri ortalama maçların yarısını kaçırıyor evet elinden geleni yapıyor GS yi seviyor savaşıyor ama yeteneği ve kapasitesi bu yani ve hata yapıyor bu 2 takılıp kalma gomis olayına evet forvet almadan satılması çok yanlıştı katılıyorum ama giden gitti artık hatalar olacaktır o yüzden şu anda gelecek vaad eden adamları almak bizim için cok önemli ben açıkçası GS nin geleceğinden ümitliyim Ya kardeş beni tanımıyorsun ve benim gibi insanlar yüzünden külüpler batıyor diyorsun  Tettehye ben kötü demedim iyi bir potansiyele sahip Ama asla çok gol atan bir forvet hissi vermiyor çok az futbolcu senede 30 gol atabilecek kapasitede ve bu kapasiteyi Tettehde görmüyorum Elmander gibi forvetler kötü müydü ? Hayır ama bir sezonda 1015 gol atıyordu Bende sana söylüyorum bize çok gol atan ve deneyimli forvet lazım Larrin potansiyelli bir oyuncu ama şimdilik asla Beşiktaşın ilk forveti olamaz bu sezon çünkü daha çok genç ve deneyimsiz Burak Yilmazın gelişi ona deneyim kazandiracak ve ilerleyen senelerde iyi bir seviyeye gelebilir  8 milyon modern futbolda önemli bir para değil ama bizim için çok para çünkü Finansal FP var Yani gelecek iki sezon için sattığın kadar almalısın Bu yüzden riskli yatırım YAPAMAZ bu yönetim Marcao riskli bir yatırım değil çünkü 4 milyon fazla miktar değil ve iyi performans sergiledi bu sezon ,2111,11,12

P Ja toen Heerenveen hem twee seizoenen geleden wou hebben heb ik een paar filmpjes van hem gezien Zag er toen wel uit als een solide verdediger zowel fysiek als aan de bal Een speler als hem moet zijn potentieel niet verkwisten in de MLS zo bedoelde ik het De Eredivisie en dan vooral bij een club als Heerenveen is een veel betere plek voor hem om te ontwikkelen als voetballer Aha op die fiets Ken hem verder niet maar geloof je op je woord Alsnog is hij redelijk jong met zijn 24 jaar dus ik denk dat er nog wel rek in zit Gezien zijn stats is hij vooral sterk met zijn duelkracht en een goede spelverdeler Dat klinkt als iemand die op CV CVM en misschien zelfs CM wel goed uit de voeten kan  Vind het trouwens ook echt wel super chill dat hij direct fit is aangezien de MLS alweer een tijdje bezig is In Columbus our coach has us playing out of the back more than any other team in MLS Naess was the best passer of all our defense so he got a lot of touches on the ball every game He never looked uncomfortable with the other teams forwards pressing and made some sweet diagonal balls to our wingers  He did get exposed by some of the pacier players in the league MLS play emphasizes athletic qualities over technical ones sadly but mostly looked promising Hope he does well for you guys Totally undeserved downgrade minor ik his Long passing is insane EA be like Oh shit hes gone to MLS? 11 SPRINT SPEED UPGRADE!

Lerager kan måske godt men han er alternativ til Delaney og spiller også normalvis box til box Jeg synes Lerager spiller godt hver gang jeg ser ham men han er ikke noget specielt Delaney er langt bedre stadig i startopstilling til landskampe O_O tror vi kunne finde 1 divisions spillere der er bedre end ham for at være ærlig Danmarksserien Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah   What is happen with him ?

Maybe his season? Maybe? I hope so! Offside merchant Been mediocre at best in FCK and suddenly scores a phenomenal hattrick in 12 minutes What happened?  Well Ståle Solbakken said in an interview that he worked alot on the way he attacks the ball from diffrent directions!  But then again its one game against a very questionable defensive effort from Lyngby but still I really hope he continues to perform great guy and really want him to have succes!  Hattrick today much needed for him Still has a lot to prove but hes starting to score goals as of recently Its great that he is starting to improve! Could have scored 6 if he was better in the air!  Lower his ball control and finishing Terrible first touches and misses so many 100 opportunities Absolutely terrible for Copenhagen so far  In my openion hes underated He hasnt really started scoringI mean hes scored a couple but his hold up play and the abillty to turn a man and shoot is great He finds teammates in open space and creates chances and gets assists aswell He presses the defenders when his team doesnt have the ball Hes passing is also way better but his strength is way to high Its like EA made him a Target Man when hes not Hes a much more Finisher Type than a Target man He tries to find space to shoot  Stats Vision 65 Short Passing 68 Aggression 70 Crossing 60 Long Passing 60 Agility 68 Reactions 66 Balance 65 Stamina 72 Stats Strength 72 Finishing 60  OVR 65 POT 72 Never Hes overrated if anything Terrible so far  Your actually right to some extend He has missed alot of chances he should have scored and I never wanted to make him better at shooting I wanted to make him a better passer of the ball which he is He doesnt throw the ball away that often and he is very aware of his teammates Thats my openion of him anyway Plus when I say hes underated I meant because I think hes better than 63 OVR BTW I edited some of the stats in my previous comment to show that I agree But hes not better than 63 ovr Look at all the possessions he throws away due to incredibly bad ball control Well i guess we just have to disagree on that ,1120,4,7

We are not struggling anymore Arteta is turning things around  Yeah United looked amazing in the first few weeks with Solskjaer Lets see where Arsenal will be at the end of the season D sure mate Arsenal might be tough at first but if he can learn everything from Özil and what hes good in while Szobo keeps his passion and work rate as well as his dribbling then we could have an insane player on our hands well have our own little KDB Why I dont want him at Arsenal because he can be a bit invisible sometimes And since Arsenal is craving for results they might put him on the side lines too soon If he gets adequate game time I have no problem with him in London no matter how Arsenal performs but thats why I am afraid from it At Lazio he might have a bit more wiggle room i feel like Lazio would be good if SMS leaves by any chance 22 m releaae clause? Ajax what are you waiting for Could grow into becoming a top player behind Ziyech  Exactly the type of player whos talented but doesnt work enough  Arsenal heres your next özil Ozil has completed 114 kilometers against United and had 10 recoveries  I didnt really watch him for Salzburg because I was interested in other games but for the National team hes one of the players who has passion and works super hard If he can keep that for club football too and if hed go to Arsenal I would hope he learns everything from Özil but keep that work rate Apparently has 22m release clause Really? If Ziyech finally doesnt come we should go get him Ziyech wont make a step downwards trust me  He should move to the Bundesliga Probably a side like Wolfsburg Schalke or Hoffenheim will suit him the best He will get lots of playtime and decent opposition so he will have to work on becoming a better player so he can reach a big club He will have a motivation to keep going and eventually he will reach his potential  True Maybe Ajax Bruges and Atalanta are also good options Same with Gladbach,718,3,6

I would imagine hes eligible for a few national teams either through blood or residence If he can play for Albania he should since theyre a lot better than Kosovo Kosovo is way way better Albania was better because Kosovo players were going to  Albania because we are same people but seperated by politics now Kosovo has many talents much more than Albania and for now Kosvo is way better Albania finished bottom in a group with Israel and Scotland whereas Kosovo topped their group and have a way into the Euros  No offense to Albania but Kosovo is a bit better and some of Albanias players are from Kosovo too  Theres a lot of talented youngsters so it wouldnt hurt to declare for Kosovo Defensive upgrade needed Started a couple of games and played really well Still raw but great attitude and mentality and work rate! ,1144,2,8

Yup if any MLS club would be interested they can pick him up on a free in the summer Nope on his way to Excelsior Well with Hateboer gone to Atalanta and no replacement this lad will be starting XI right back from next match on   Did very well in the matches he already played Now we can see if hell be able to keep it up I think both Groningenfans and USAfans have been waiting for this  I think considering how unbelievably thin the US is at left back he should at least be given a chance  Fabian Johnson should be on the left wing! Since FC Groningen didnt have a lot of fit wingbacks last season he did play 9 games for our first team and he did pretty good 67 would be a better rating Could grow into a decent player shows good promise He still needs some time though not good enough to be a first team player for us yet Hes actually a right back tho Make his preferred position to RB How good is he?

He was injured but he recovered in the beginning of 2019 6782 This kid seems to have a poor injury tolerance and his defending is limited to ball watching with little or no marking He clearly lacks the physique to break into the starting line up and he lacks some initiative aggression? He has impressive vision and composure but I dont see his overall rating being higher than 66 even though Cocu claimed this guy was more ready to break into the starting 11 than Baris Alici Ferdi Kadigolu is currently rated at 67 and thats fair for now but this guy isnt superior in overall ability compared to Ferdi Kadioglu I would suggest the following Marking 57 Standing Tackle 58 Slide Tackle 56 Well hes at 63 anyway so? Id think he should be an 65 His defensive stats are fine as well His performance against Ankaragucu wasnt convincing Ayew and Slimani were playing in a more deeper role to provide zonal marking when Ankaragucu scored their first goal In fact Ayew seems like a better slide tackler than this kid as well Several players were trying to defend including our sole striker but Oguz was ball watching during a set piece Alper Dirar and even Ismail Koybasi are all more gutsy man markers than this kid 66  83 Bolca agresyon ve biraz daha standing tackle Ayrıca hızlanma ve çeviklik de artırılmalı Deserves more chances 6582 Vayyy FIFA sen böyle potansiyel verir miydin bize Crazy stamina stats Makes him unusable as a CDM ,67,0,0

From what Ive seen and been told he probably deserves 3 Pintor is a nice prospect and his exceptionally gifted at dribbling with great excelleration of the mark and a eye for goal Another outstanding performer for France at the u17 World Cup which the team had a decent run  Pintor has great potential to play for a top five top six club in any of the major leagues across Europe hence the fact Lyon purchased him though he was close to joining Valencia in Spain this summer Personally I  would have liked to see him stay for a season at Brest Their a team capable of pushing for promotion and they were slowly bring him along the same way they did with Ibrahima Sissoko Pintor even made a couple of appearances Young players in general need game time to build on their experience which can be hard to find at such a young age a top tier clubs  Lyon should have loaned him back he could have played more of a pivotal role All in all his capable of having a wonderful career some of the top EPL sides showed interest in him every clip ive seen of him he has rubbish finishing his finishing when comparing to pros can improve but at the youth level and playing at youth international tournaments his one of the regulars on the scorers sheets  He gets away with it at the youth level but needs more coaching and experience at senior level This is an argument I made playing time will be harder to find at Lyon but at Brest he would have been involved more in the first team and playing against professionals in game time situations and thats what he needs  But their is no denying his ability he just needs that experience so he can make that progression as a top tier professional player Wait I thought Carl was the black one?

Yeah First game back and he scores Hows is he doing? Hes doing good for the club though hes not where I hoped to be at this stage  He seems to be squad depth that gets consistent minutes rather than a star that held his starting spot  Hes done well when on the pitch though He is 20 Still has a lot of potential Realistically where do yous place him at potential wise? I think where he is now is fair  He would bring a different dimension to the national squad and can be a menace for a tired opposition defense as a sub I saw him get his for cap for the usmnt but tbh his end product was egh Was very fast and at times could really take people on the dribble I havent seen much since that game of his Hes either injured or playing Hes had various small injuries that have prevented him from being a constant fixture for the first team this season Yet to break 1000 domestic league minutes this season scored today To a spanish speaker he looks delicioso! Pfffft  Overrated as fck! Finally he gets some of the respect he deserves    His passing crossing dribbling and control are massively underrated May I ask What is your name?

Poulsen is a LB Arias a RB You know the difference???? Next to that Arias is way better FCK Going to sign for PSV Underrated Have you seen him play for Denmark? Hes been an effing disaster!

He is a good player At the start of the season he was injured and if he was there we may have qualified for Europa League group  Hes got strength runs a lot to cover area on the field can intercepttackle well  Imo he should be rated 7484  Id say hes got a similar style of play as Matuidi with more strength And how is his passing and dribbling? From what you say I think that he has the same play style as Bakayoko Passing and dribbling are on point and he has a good vision on the field  Well he is a bit similar as Bakayoko but less technical I would say I am confused Do you say that he is less technical than Bakayoko but Bakayoko is not technical And before you said that his dribbling and passing are on point Can you explain? From what I remember Bakayoko from AS Monaco was a technical player I never saw him play for the other club he went in  Fofana uses his physical attributes to keep the ball and go forward ,908,2,5

I think if he was to leave to another team in Scotland it would be hearts or killebut I think hell move down south Scottish clubs just cant compete with the money down south unfortunately hell prob head down just signed for prestons dteam no way hes this shit Worst loaned player in FIFA 16 hes between the 26 worst players of the game I dont think any football player should be under the rating of 60 Im sorry but you dont understand how the rating system works then I dont think anyone understands how eas rating system works XD I think I do tbh Those ratings are only abstract numbers defining a certain area of the skills they describe So eg having 1 ball control doesnt necessarily mean youre the worst person on the planet in terms of that attribute So having a rating of 48 may mean that youre pretty bad in terms of a professional footballer but youre probably still better than most of the people on this site eg 48!?!?!?! If you add ten to each of his rating he will become a 58 rated player There is always one ,2671,0,9

Bundesliga ,3.0,0.0,4.0,Cant see him being good enough Seems like he is not focussed on his career at all Eligible to play for the USMNT Better on twitch then on the pitch Why!? ?? The potential downgrade EA smokes  Do you think he will play a major role next year at Hertha ? Difficult to say without knowing who will be the coach Also I havent seen that much of him recently Is he really such an allrounder that he can play everywhere? Hes played CM in the youth theam as well as in the reserve team SOmetimes his role was more defensive sometimes he had a more offensive part He also played RM for a few games if I remember correctly Personally I have never seen him playing CB and I watched him quite a lot since the 1516 season IMO he is too bad defensively to be a proper CB but his passing is decent If he improves his defensive abilities he would have good potential to become a solid CB but as of now I can only imagine him play as CM CAM or CDM Management has said that he is planned as a CB which I hope is not true From what I have seen hes a box to box player striving for goals Thats not the typical Hertha Style to play so it wont be easy for him to get some playtime I do really like this sort of player so I hope well get to see him in the Hertha jersey  ,633,2,3

I think Ben Yedders stats are fine with 88 acceleration and 81 sprint speed  Salibas pace needs upgrading to something that resembles 71 acceleration and 83 sprint speed Saliba was already nearer to the ball so he didnt really beat him exactly I heard good stuff about him and Bastoni Is he an elegant defender like van Dijk or Ferdinand for example? Or more the guy for the dirty work? Or any other category? Im curious Ive never seen him play but I have a special admiration for center backs so I cant wait until hes in England based off highlights almost all his tackles are ridiculously clean and elegant i havent watched games tho so dont take my word for it  Based on 2 full matches vs Monaco with Ben Yedder he is elegant He plays just like van Dijk with good tackles and good passing  Extremely elegant Both defending and with the ball Honestly the comparison to VVD is only natural because Saliba genuinely looks like a young VVD Their playing styles are so similar Saliba imo is actually much much better at 18 than VVD was at the same age So saying he can reach the same level might be towering too much pressure on him but that is not something that the quality he is showing now is not inviting more so with each passing game  The difference between SaintEtienne with Saliba and without Saliba is almost ridiculous Its actually very good for him that Arsenal allowed him to stay another season in Ligue 1 to improve a bit but Arsenal quite needs a good CB I was expecting Tah in the summer but in the end hell end up at BayernDortmund Nope I see a Transfer to Arsenal way more realistic than a transfer to us or Bayern  Were you expecting Julian Brandt to Dortmund?

Hes been fucking reeking lol He is not that good in this season then he was last season but who is from City? Maybe De Bruyne because the much less injury and Mahrez Apart from these everyone is quite inconsistent Even with that he deserves more! Last season performances 89 this season 88  a bit too much ball control dribbling and stamina funny way of saying ive never seen him play  Ive been watching him play since his Monaco days 8891 Why isnt he 90 yet?  Hes inconsistent but tbf hes better as Cam than rw where hes been sharing time with mahrez Try taking off your Portuguese glasses That might help He should be 88 rated Great player and all but not a 90 rated player  No bias he deserves it in my opinion he was the best player in the league last season and also best Portuguese player He has had a meh season but not even Hazard was 87 back when Chelsea were playing like shit  He has 5 goals in 20 matches why da hell he would deserve 90 rating?!? You clearly lack some brainsells if you think that few goals mean bad skills You dont need to score goals to be a good passer or dribbler or even good at shooting And as I said before he is indeed having a poor season but he isnt a winger either he is a center midfielder So its normal to assume he just isnt suited to that position  Hes inconsistent as fuck hes not even better than de bruyne to deserve such rating to be a 90 rated player he must be a genius in midfield which is not his case Oblak has 0 goals how the hell is he 91????????????????

Fernandinho is the perfect DM for a Guardiola team Busquets is better obviously he can read the game  he can pass and the moronic fouls you are talking about are called tactical fouls to break a counter  It seems you have a fetish for garbage  Busquets Fernandinho and perfect DM in the same sentence?

Will it happen? HELL NO with Woody in charge similar play style to him? Zielinski Oh boy! Oh boy! Should go to la liga  cos hes spanish? Not necessarily but thats a plus Hes got nice touch to his passing game and La Liga is built off the passing game Would probably play better in La Liga with weaker defenses too Not that he plays bad in Italy  ik my post was a joke im a Napoli fan and I think you are right Id love to see him at Barcelona or with Pep at City I think he would thrive at either of those clubs because of their style of play Pero a donde van con 90 de potencial?

Uff no sé La verdad es que tengo cierta predilección por el argelino me parece un defensa muy completo y que ha mostrado una progresión notable que puede continuar y creo que Setién también está enamorado de él no hay más que oír como lo puso como ejemplo de profesionalidad esfuerzo y constancia a unos niños muy recomendable de ver el vídeo de verdad Otra cosa es ver como llega Feddal que prácticamente no ha entrenado nada en pretemporada y lleva 7 meses en el dique seco pero es el único zurdo y eso siempre es un plus Tampoco creo que Setién ande pensando mucho en el músculo máxime con la incorporación de Carvalho pero ojo que Mandi no va corto de eso tampoco En cualquier caso va a jugar y bastante porque luego lesiones sanciones etcBuen fichaje y centrales cerrados y a otra cosa Un saludo!!! A mi tambien me parece mejor Mandi pero tengo esa duda Jugando Bartra y Mandi por ejemplo contra Diego Costa o William Jose la van a pasar putas en ese caso por ejemplo pondria yo a Sidnei  No se ni si sigue en el Depor pero me habria gusta mas Schar que Sidnei Es cierto contra delanteros más fuertes nos puede venir mejor pero hay que tener en cuenta que en cualquier caso va a necesitar un cursillo intensivo de Setién para coger las ideas de juego Pero vamos vaya suerte la nuestra de poder tener esas variantes no? Al final lo de 2º3º4º centralTodo es a priori luego la realidad es tozuda y muchas veces contradice estas opiniones  El vídeo que te comentaba de Setién para mí una auténtica maravilla nhttpswwwyoutubecomwatch?vvj2BSdz689M Un fuerte abrazo bético! Bueno cuanto mas jugadores mejor desde luego pero si quiere jugar con 3 centrales esta corto aunque me imagino que jugara con 2 No he visto en pretemporada con que han jugado ya tengo bastante con estar pendiente de si va a fichar un 9 mi equipo este año o si lo dejan para invierno  Entiendo que ese equipo es el de la acera de enfrente jeje Aboubakar y Batshuayi parecen las mejores opciones la verdad Maxi Gómez tengo aún la duda de si simplemente es que le ha salido un año espectacular y ya está no sé por qué pero no me termina No sé si hay alguien más en la terna son los nombres que he visto por la prensa Que tal pintan Amadou y Gnagnon? No sé nada de ellos Batshuayi lo dudo mucho pero por soñar con Aboubakar me vale me sorprende que no suene Milik que me gustaria tambien Amadou en la pretemporada de lo mejor Gnagnon tiene buena pinta Suelen salir bien los fichajes de Francia en el Sevilla creo que saldran bien ambos,1742,1,9

Not accurate enough in all aspects of his game  his dribbling his crossing his shooting his setpiece input his positioning and chemistry with teammates I still have hope for this guy though you can tell he has all the qualities of a modern winger but he cant seem to perform that well on a regular basis Its too bad there is no consistency rating in the game because even though his 70 rating is sometimes deserved he also often plays like a low60s Hes a real workhorse though he makes a lot of runs forward and often asks for the ball but defends a lot as well The workrates are spot on but the stamina should be in the low 80s  He has upped his game a little over the past few weeks and seems really motivated by the prospect of earning promotion Was his move to FC Metz successful or not ? The league table is very tight from 3rd to 7th and the last four games of the season will be key moments home vs 6th placed Red Star and away vs 4th placed rivals of RC Lens in making his season successful He could be a decisive force for the team if he keeps this good form running Went to FC Granada on loan OVERRATED 78 Potential ,2265,5,15

I admite that editors take way too long to edit teams but this isnt only about 1 team in the league its more than half of it Many clubs in the relegation zone in LaLiga are rated 77 whereas Granada and Osasuna are comfortable in 11th and 12th respectively and yet somehow they are both 73 rated Its been 4 months already and for example in the Portuguese league theyve already started to downgrade massively teams eithe deserved or not same goes to other leagues like Bundesliga and Serie A then I wonder why it isnt the same case with the EPL even though I can only find two serious cases in that league Watford and Sheffield and LaLiga  fifa editors barely do shit idk whats hard to understand about this its the same thing for years they do shit so randomly and without reason theres no way to justify it you also have to understand that some teams are more than the sum of their parts ie sheffield players arent that incredible but as a unit are tough as nails same with getafe The league still is overrated and the fact that other leagues are edited regularly only demonstrates that LaLiga is special not to be mean but players from Espanyol got upgrades since FIFA 20 launched  other leagues are edited regularly fam it took like 3 months for one of serie a brightest young players in kulusevski to get updated once lmao other leagues doesnt mean all other leagues Taken out of context  Also Serie A never gets updated Milan still is overrated as shit But thats because EA has a beef with Calcio Serie A not because of a deal that grants 4 extra ratings of overall  Thats just not true Put benfica or any other Portuguese team in la liga and theyll be battling for relegation cmon man dont exaggerate benfica and porto would probably be competing for europa league spots Thats complete nonsense and you know it No its not Yes it is never understood the interest in this guy at all i remember him being linked with bayern and being confused hes not awful just doesnt look like hell ever come close to that potential rating Nolito regen Vien à lOM  How is he doing?  httpswwwyoutubecomwatch?vvsm4nFusKVw Welcome to Bayern Will be cheaper for bayern to use their youth  For real tho They need to develop there youth talent or else we wont have any good homegrown players,2353,6,8

Home? Theres so many bad moments from him Quirynen has been way better and doesnt even get in the 18 man squad hes starting every week De Laet should get to play there in the future if not Quirynen  I knew this would happen  Played as LB before 2016 but then 2 years as rightmidwing and at first when he arrived at Antwerp as a LB all good but after a few months now you start to notice that he isnt that good defensively For next season a new LB and play him in front again but can still be backup for LB Youre right he is not exactly amazing defensively Should use him on the right wing He is best when he can cut inside and shoot long shots with his left foot like Robben Yes but hes not good dribbling wise very bad in many 1 on 1s He has a very good shot a decent cross but terrible work rate he could play as a LWB or RWB easily but not as a LB LM nor RM for a team pushing for top 3  Wouldnt work either he always does the same dribble and only knows how to low cross he has a decent shot but it goes outside the stadium once in a while so you dont know what type of shot youll get he cant cross on his right foot either so hed have to play LM and he doesnt stand a chance against Mirallas Lamkel Zé Benson nor Rodrigues on the wings  Hidden gem If only that was the case in real life  7377 Deserves to be 7478 7378 Hes the best LB in Belgium 7378 Hes a beast Potentetial needs too 7879  He is top of the league with assists and has the best stats in belguim  as a leftback  ,3445,1,13
